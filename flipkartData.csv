1-more flexible2-bass is very high3-sound clarity is good 4-battery back up to 6 to 8 hour's 5-main thing is fastest charging system is available in that. Only 20 min charge and get long up to 4 hours back up 6-killing look awesome 7-for gaming that product does not support 100% if you want for gaming then I'll recommend you please don't buy but you want for only music then this product is very well for you.. 8-no more wireless headphones are comparing with that headphones at this pric...,5
Super sound and good looking I like that prize,5
"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day",5
Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money,5
"Wowwww it's amezing bluetooth nice look, nice price, nice battery back up, I love always flipkart product's and Flipkart replacement and refund policy, you can return or refund after received a demegzed product",5
Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.,4
"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet..",5
First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good.  I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.,4
This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup             2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please,1
It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super,5
Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner,4
"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is  very low. I didn't expect this.",1
Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning)  and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.,1
"Wow flip cart super fast service like  express speed delivery I order 11 am delivery At 5pm I am very happy,  boAt Bluetooth headset is very very excellent product fast charging super totally user friendly go for it",5
Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great 👌 and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great,5
It's very good and its bass is very high This bluetooth is very good best value or money but battery is too tiny.....Battery backup is not long time but it's realy fast charging support so little battery is comfortable with fast charging,4
"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" 😄😄😉",5
"This review is after 1 month of use .Pro:- 1.Battery backup is genuinely too good, runs almost 1.5 -2 days on a single charge.. and 8hrs on continuous playback.2. Charge very fast,,, 40% just in 15-20 minutes3. Sound is crisp,clear and decent, not too loud.  4. Build quality is awsome nd stylish as well.5.connectivity is super fast nd good with phones.6. Last but not the least,,, its really comfort able nd i didn't feel any discomfort or pain even after continous use of 5 hrs which i ...",5

"Hi Seekers, I am writing this review after 2 weeks of daily use, lets start with pros and cons Pros-✓Sounds Quality is good✓ Bass is good enough✓ Look is okay as per this price range ✓ All essential controls are provided✓ Backup is decentConsxx Bluetooth range is too short (even if you are walking by holding phone in your hand you will feel connection disturbances at all times)xx In case of battery get low it continuously gives you a voice signals in every 2 seconds I found its ver...",3
Great product.. I loved it.. As I was using level U.. This product is much more better than that.. Though battery life is just like 8hrs and bass like goosebumps... But when increased bass earplugs starts raddling.. Vibrate feature is awesome..,4
"Awesome product happy to have one.Good sound quality in medium volume, with equalizer app could complete the high bass sound. Battery last long 20 min of charge to enjoy whole day.Very light weight, Easy to carry,",4
It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb,4
"Amazing product   Sound quality was awesome, it has deep bass which I really wanted, I am really satisfied and battery backup was also nice and it also had fast charging facilities",5
I think it is the best product in this price segment I buy this product after seeing it's sell figure and my decision got right u must buy this product I love it's sound quality but the build quality must be improved and they must give charging adaptor out of the box,4
Best product at this price loved it. Thank you flipkart for safe delivery 💯😃,5
Excellent voice clarity superb bass for music lovers. Overall a very good product.,4
"This earphone is just awsome yaar , everything is just so perfect yaar just go for it blindly ,i tell you u cant find a best product at this price its awsome👌👌👌👌",5
It is an amazing product.. For this price... Less weight.. Flexible.. Super sound... Extra feature is call vibration.. Nice one.. Try it..,5
The product was good enough.. Stylish blur color with well designed earphones.. Coming to the specifications sound and bass was superb... Value for money... Batery backup is also good around 6 hours life.... No lag in PUBG... Highly satisfied but have to wait and see how long it works like this,5
Boat headset is very clear voice and bass is v good and plus point is fast charging 20 mint to 4 hrs batery backup... One of the best bluetooth headset....osmmm products,5
"A fine product i would say , well crafted design and good build quality ..  good fit and comfortable to wear ... enough bass to provide u good sound experience .. although not the most premium quality but still considering the price it's well ahead of it .. manages lows and highs well, sound mixing and good listening experience when it comes to music video and others ..the only CON i noticed was the microphone .. i think this device is not built for calling ... sometimes the voice is not eve...",3
Good product very fast delivery (with in 36 hours only) superb color love it,5
Boat rockerz 235 v2 is the budget blutooth hearphone. All are very good performance only sound quality is slightly poor.. vibration and battery backup is the best part in this product. Bass also very great .. just lysric clearing not proper,4
If you are a bass lover then blindly go for it . And I think 8 hours of backup is enough and 4 hours charge in 20 mins .what else we want . Superb,5
"Review after about 2months of usage.Before starting let me be clear, THIS DEVICE IS NOT FOR SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS/AUDIOPHILES.I'm not gonna repeat the same technical aspects of it, you already know what's inside it. So...Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud. So no complaints there.If you've used some premium earphone from brands lik...",4
Im a jbl user ..boat 235v2 battery is too good to stay 2 days..fast charging..bass is 5 of 5 but sound of vocal is 4 of 5.. mic is good ..although i bought this in 1299 ..in this range its good,4
The boat 235v2 is really good it's sounds very clear and also good bass. If you think buy a Bluetooth headset go for It. Just sounds and battery backup is awesome.,5
"Above from my expectation, after reading the review i opted for not to purchase this product but guys you won't believe it really work, too good sound quality, superb bass overall it is lovelly one....will make ur day sweet.......bass lover will loved it.This boat 235v2 is better than boult pro bass product coz i ordered both the earphone jst as to compare the quality and boat rockerz is jst uncomaprable...perfect tune...superb acaustic....voice calling is far better that boult earphone........",4
I brought this product as I was looking for a sweat proof headset for my workouts. I got it for 899 and I have to say that am pretty satisfied with the features and the quality that the headset has to deliver. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. Just go for it !!!,5
Ti's is my first Bluetooth headset it is wonderful and color is more attractive and the sound quality is good and it is good product and value of money is 5star and battery is good,5

It so nice but nickband so tall but otherwise is best headphone call vibraion and fast charging nice product.....,5
It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue.  That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for.  Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.,5
Very nice very satisfied and sound quality very good bass is excellent overall worth it,5
First of all it looks very perfect and is non fragile and awesome experience using this.....just fast delivery and well packed ....just perfect qs a product can be...and the best part is its mindblowing sound quality thunping my ears.....,5
"I think for this price range, it's one of the best available in market. sound quality is good and loudness is nothing short of excellence. Bluetooth connectivity is too good. Satisfactory with looks and build quality, could have been better.",5
i have ordered 2 headset reallyyyy awesome highly recommended for all good quality great supporting ear bud bass was veryyyy nyc,5
Perfect sound for the perfect priceI have been using it from three months everything is working good and best compare to another boat earphone. I just don't know why the company not issued any warranty for it.                          THANQ,4

"Best bluetooth headset in terms of bass, battery backup and fast charging,  this is only and only and only for listening songs, like while doing the workout ... but it is not meant for gaming and not even for watching videos cause I noticed a lot of lag,delay in delivering the audio,  if u want to play the games like pubg , pls dont go for it, and even the keypad tic tic sounds while typing are delayed for about a half a second , this headset is only for those people who ALWAYS LISTENS  TO mu...",4

Wow what a great product for in this price Fabulous sound quality and Aowsome battery backup I love this earphone and thanks Flipkart or boAt...,5
I would divide it in pros and cons...Pros:-1-good built quality2-excellent fit3-balanced sound4-good batery backup5- wireless range is good acc to price6-passive noise isolation is also acceptable7- Treible is good Cons:-1- Low bass#Others are good but it is good for a price at which I have got it i.e.899 more than this is not worthy for it,4
"Very sexy in look wise ... Awesome in this price range but boult audio curve is better option , good base and battery backup ..",4

Decent product and value for money. This is built with a very good design. The sound quality is medium and little low quality sound during calls and receiving calls. Not much of a bass sound quality effect. Overall a good product to go for in this price.,5
Good product battery backup was good and sound quality also good i loved it 😍,5
They are really amazing worth of money nd sounds good while hearing songs. I'm satisfied with the product too much ?. Thank you...,5
"Sound for listening music is sufficient and balanced sound for light user, bass is normal not a very high bass. Having distorted while making a call. But also a positive sign that is a battery backup, company provides 8hr battery backup and that's true, battery backup is very good at this price. Overall at this budget price range this boat 235v2 Bluetooth Headphone is good and value for money.",3
Superb Product Awesome bass Awesome battery backup & fast charging excellent Bluetooth connectivity All over 5/5.....👌,5
sound quality is good. but earbuds are a bit rough.but ok. bass is good. build quality is what I like the most. battery backup is also nice. overall a good product. worth for your money delivery is a bit late and could be fast,4
"The Boat rockerz 235v2 is really a good wireless earphone,The build quality is awesome 👌👍The bass is very good and the most interesting part of this device is the call vibration.Thankyou boat for this good features.",3

Good product at this prize good sound good base must buy,5
"Not so comfortable to wear and ear started paining after 5 min of use and music is not so clear we feel like hearing a radio,",1
Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds  not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds  design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating),3
"I got this earphone right now everything was ok but when i plugged in charging led light was not working it was really low when i saw it properly , I don't know if this is with my piece only or led is low .",3
The earphones are very good if you are looking at buying one for listening to music. Please look for other options if you intend to make calls as well. The microphone is not great and the person on the other side of the call will not be able to hear you clearly,2
"Some times buttons not workingSome times incoming call voice not activating we need to disconnect and reconnect again..Battery is excellent almost 3days backup for callsCharging very fast few minutes onlyBass level and sound clarity is good. Vibration while call waiting is irritating, not need this future Finally i will give only ⭐⭐ for this product.",2
"Brilliant earphones,,    With extraordinary battery backup. I didn't expect this much.  Supremely tuned sound. Hifi bass.     Balanced stereo sound. Go for it.                           Thank you.",5
"Sound is really good seeing the price range..I got it for 899/-, so happy with the quality. Previously using Mivi Thunderbeats with 13mm drivers, so it now feels a little low in sound now..bt if u see the price(at 899) its a good package. Bt yes I noticed the call quality is not so good. The other person on the call can't hear my every word properly. Using Boat Basshead wired also, bt this prblm is not there with that.",4
Everything good i order same product just because of quality and backup and best fitting everything is nice and also good sound quality in this budget thanks flipkart,4
"This is my first neckband earphone, i am really surprised for this product and truly happy good quality, nice sound and build quality is very well.. Really happy 😊",4
It's works fine and superb with this budget. Only thing is it will not compatible for PUBG game you will get the sound later for every action. Ex. You get the enemies foots sound after arrival means later.,4
I bought it for my mom and it's good.....well just good nothing more there are some issues but they can be neglected considering the price so if someone is on a tight budget then this is good or else I will recommend to go for oneplus bullets z earphone they are far better than these.,5
Beat product for normal people for class office work and song streaming ....Sound quality osm : no vibration or cracks with highest volume also...Battery back up good : with morning 100% charge last till night on continues useing ... Experience of 3 months ...Hardware : has been fallen from 4 to 5 feet 3 to 4 times all is fine Vibration : the vibration when we get call the band near the neck vibrates not so harsh so it's goood Best part : connects 2 device at a time which will help ...,5
Awesome product. Value for money. Good sound quality with better bass. Best thing is battery backup it last up to 12 to 14 hrs in single charge. Surely suggested......👍,4
"Good quality sound output from the earphones. Battery backup is good as per product specification do meets the exact backup time. Reacharge also won't take much time. Only thing I found little bit bad was the thin wires used. If you are a tough user go for flat wired type boat models, this one could break if not used safely and softly. Good product.",4
"Good product,  I liked ,decent sound quality, good battery backup. Charging port is not in proper place  it should have been in different place. Call  quality is good. Thanks Flipkart",4
Very good headset with very good sound quality and charging is very fastOnly thing is that the support for ear plugs can be made little bit more comfortableOverall a very good product.,4
Ear buds not comfort to ears.last call memory is there.next song forward is not there.we can't skip present song to go next song.very good blue tooth set for that price.very fast charging.charging cable.is given. charging adopter not given. over-all one should buy this.buy and enjoy .triple sound s are not effective.,4

"I have purchased it in 899. After using 3 days I am writing this review.  It has very good battery backup. In 10 min charge you can used it for 2.5 hr. Sound quality is good. It has good bass as well. Previously I was using boat 255 and it has better bass and design as well. The issue in it the connectivity is not much good. If you have put mobile in your pocket then Somtimes you will feel distortion. But if you love balanced music, then it is not for you. Go for others Brand with more ...",5

"sound quality is good... expecially the bassthe design is much pretty but its hard to wear in the sleepy times. its mat finish is much impressive nd it also  with the inbuilt mic and battery backup , nd its bass is the main quality.. nd product quality is much better.in this price range its the best option ...its not more flexible ... we cant carry it in the pocket .. but usually its a neckband.. and it suit perfect and work perfect ..and it vibrating when we got a call .  its a good thi...",1
Although it's too early to write a review after just one day of use but I was using skullcandy method for two years but due to support local manufacturer this time I decided to purchase these earphones and believe me it's way more better than any other so called established brands. Sound and Bass are next level cool Bettery back up is also goodVibration during incoming call is a feature which was missing in skullcandy method which was 3200 while it's cost is 864(During sale).,4
"It's not too good , When I play any song fast I hear a sound like ""kachh"" sound quality is not good",3

"Sound quality not that good. Can't play it in full volume. Boat rockers 255 is way better than this product. I would definitely not recommend this earphone as if u add some 300rs to this price you can go for boat rockers 255. Avoid buying this, it's not worth ot",2

Battery backup and build quality is good. Look wise also good. Fitted well in ear. But not happy with sound quality of song. You will need to install seprate equalizer application for better sound .,4
I love it specially because of battery backup.. sound quality is actually good but if you looking at it for calling purpose only so don't buy it. Noise cancelling doesn't work properly in these earphones others wise very nice product for those who love watching movies for hours and play games too,5
Must buy bluetooth headset. Guys blindly go for this headset. Very very worthy. It looks like more premium and got good design. It looks more premium than 255 F model. The most important thing in this headset is adjustable wire strap.,5
Review after 20 days of use.First of all bass is good if you love bass then go for it without second thought.Lags in build department as wires are thin.Have magnetic buds with no functionality i don't know why they provided.Connectivity is good i can hear music from one room to other without much distortion.If you are buying for general use like music and stuff then it's okay but for gamers or i say pubg players then you will be disappointed becoz they are just bad in that department the...,4
Good Quality i use this everyday but its design is have to like Samsung's level U product. Otherwise its sound quality is awesome in this price level.,5

Connecting wires feel fragile not for very rough use. ...,4
"To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900..... But in this Bluetooth one it's not that great.... But still according to the price it is a good deal. Battery back up is good and the build quality is nice......",4

I just loved it because it's under best budget and good sound quality build quality little bit better overall performance of this headphone great.,5
Using it for few days. Really nice product. Pros:1. Superb build quality and comfortable.2. Excellent sound quality with a bit heavy bass.3. Good battery backup and fast charging.4. Call (Both ph and whatsapp) quality is also good.Cons:1. Connection gets weaker after ~20 ft.2. Answering/Rejecting whatsapp call doesn't work.,5
Excellent overall sound quaLity. Very good product with very good features. Recommended for everyone.,5
"Bought this pretty decent Headset about a month ago.Here are the pros: Good sound quality and bass, Bluetooth 5.0 with easy connectivity, Water proof and sweat proof. Cons: The wires are pretty thin and fragile. Should take extreme care. If you're a rough user, you might wanna rethink on buying this.Overall a good headset at decent price... So far so good.",4
"It is my first purchase for wireless Bluetooth, it is cool.. I  was looking for sound feature which it has awesome sound and cool headset. Fully satisfied with product.",5
"Super sound clarity and really good quality deep bass,and very fast charging.Thanks flipcart for quality product.",5
"Good looks, light weight, value for money.Pros Good battery back, up to 8hrs and above if charged proper for 2hrs.Sound quality is very good for music, calls quality also good, Cons Bass heavy, Ok on medium sound,,Wires quite thin should have been little thick",4
Wires connected to the earbuds are very thin...it would be great if the wires used were thick. Otherwise it is great experience to use it...looks far better than boat rockerz 255f as it is very outdated now.,4
"Nice design, build quality & nice colour. Good sound quality, bass and nice Call mic quality. I loved the product. Best Bluetooth earphones in this price range",5
Fastest deliver ( i recieved the product in the next day ) & amazing product with good sound clarity. Great battery backup,5
"Nice one at this prise range ,and it's good i got this at 860 rupees , we can connect 2 phones at a time ,mic quality is awesome ,bass is amazing",4
Flipkart delivery was fast and product was good but I ordered blue colur I got black. Everything else was good. Go for it very good headphones in this price value for money,5
"I got it for 899rs. According to this price the product Is pretty good, sound quality is average  but the earlocks are pretty painfull if you wear it for too long over all  it's good product for this price range.i bought this because of quick charging which work really well and save your time.",3
It's such a nice product in this valuable price... Just loved it seriously don't think too much guys just go for it.....,5
Excellent.. my 1st bluetooth Headset & m very much Happy with it.. 999/- is the best cost for this headset..Truly worth it..,5
"i got the headset today. just dhamaka pack device.. sound quality, bass boosted, design awasome.. fast connect to  mobile. very comfortable item. now i am new fan of boat headset.. now let see how much it durable.. i liked it💓",5
"This product it means it amazing , seriously its superb , sound or bass yr outstanding or awesome , i think u should going for buy this without any doubts , I personally really ❤️ it 👌👌",5
It is so good in awesome product I am so happy e this product battery backup he is good,5
Just go for it.... u cant purchase better wireless earphone at this range....its sound quality is not so good on watching you tube video but it is fabulous when i listend it from Wynk music app with changing in equalizer....i recommend u to listen songs on this on ur music app....it is far better.,5
"Guys, today I got my order. The sound quality and the bass is awesome. but don't buy this for PubG as you get latency. you will hear after 2 - 3 secs of firing, footsteps, and messages. So, for music and calls its pretty good but for gaming don't buy this. Go for 255F for PUBg.",4
Good product. But if u want for playing PUBG ITS NOT GOOD TOO MUCH AUDIO DELAY. I TRY LOTS OF THINGS TO FIX BUT . ITS DIDN'T WORK. FOR MUSIC AND CALLS ITS GOOD BUT FOR PUBG I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT ONE.,5
Delivery of product in one day and product quality also good I loved it thank Flipkart for ur commitment delivered in one day,4
"I bought this blue colored awesome headphone only at 899 during the pandemic time.Before I say about the product, I would I like to add a special thanks to flipkart and ekart delivery boy who helped me and supported me in change to delivery address and gave it to me safely.NowAbout the product its a really nice product at this price, sound and bass quality is quite impressive and battery backup is more than 8hrs.I just received it by today, so will give further review after a month.",5
"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good.",5
The best earohones so far. The buil quality is little cheap but it won't feel that much... Sound quality is good and bass is alsoo good .. overall worth the price.,4
Great headset With mind blowing bass and decent sound...Nervous abt the built quality finishing is not too good but still i enjoy the music overall this is the best product i suggest to purchase...,5
It's good right now. Working good. Happy using it. Use it for taking online classes and yoga and it's just working beautifully.,4
It's nice product & good sound & good base                    Designed is super and smooth control tqs flipkart,5
"Everything is fine about this product except the wire quality. Its not bad, bt can be improved.Otherwise best if you see price wise",4
"Very good for average users who are not looking for deep bass. Battery life is decent and charge time is quick.A few times there is some sort of connection problems and the headset keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, but it happens only once or twice in 2 to 3 days so nothing to worry about.Also while answering calls sometimes though the headset is connected you wont be able to answer and the inbuilt vibrator wont stop even after answering the call through your phone.Nice mids and averag...",4
Awesome product it is very useful to taking call while on drive and good designed for wire strip come with this is good to see totally worthy to purchase,4
The best product in this price range. I mean what more can you expect from a product @899/- only.Sound quality is average. Clarity is not good. However bass is good. Battery backup and fast charging is awesome.,5
"Good Design , Good Build Quality , Battery Backup is also Good & Works Properly",5
Awesome product I used so many headsets but I feel good nice product vibration alert is nice I buy this in sale for 899Rs,4

"Posting this review after use of one day. The build quality of this product is very good, quality of material is great. Big battery backup as claimed by the company so for build quality n battery backup 5 out of 5. But if we compare sound quality then i qm quite disappointed. My local earphones giving nice sound than this, for me sound quality should have been more better than this, i wanted to return this product but there is no option of cash refund and now have to bear loss for this. I sho...",3
"Pretty Happy with the Bass and Lowest price range.Actually it is far better than the higher version of rockers itself in the design aspect.also it offers a decent sound quality.Don't compare it with headphones of 2k price range.If you are not happy in spending more than 1k then go for it.It delivers good sound quality in voice calling also,and Mic is decent.It will never disappoint you.",5
"best in market..superb quality and very good battery backup,235v2 boat is much better than other boat Bluetooth..sound is superb",4
Best in budget best in bass vocals treble...got it at 850/-  in offer gud battery backup lasts up to 6 to 7 hrs based on volume and fast charging is an top edge thing to this product without any dout go for it writing this review after using it for a week countinuesly and call quality is superb,5
Pros.1) bass is good 2) design is very good and build quality is also very nice3)ear fiting is really really good4)can connect to 2 devicesCons.1) connectivity is fast but audio lag is there.     A real noticeable gap that can make video different.2) connectivity is fast but sometimes showing connected but doesn't playing audio in earphone.3) treble is low and bass is high so sometimes in some song you will feel need of treble .Conclusion:-A good earphone with very sleek design a...,4
"These earphones are really amazing and worth buying. .. only for those who loves playing song , movies or for gym purpose ... Those who wants to buy it for pubg .. i request u not to buy... Because sound comes after the gun shut.. sound delayed by some mini seconds.. not exactly when u fire..Otherwise it will be perfect 🤩And also thanks Flipkart",5
That earphones are amazing bass are very powerful and good sound quality........ love you boat...and love you flipkart.,5
DELIVERY IS GOOD IN BEFO ON TIME THANK U FLIPKART. PRODUCT IS AMAZING LOVE IT,5
This is amazing compact product  and sound quality is too good  when compared to boat 255f or audio curve this is flagship... Verry good Battery for 15min or charge it will be like 80% just go for it....!!!,5
"Sound and bass is undoubtedly awesome in this price range.Battery performance is very good hence m using this from 1 week.Mic performance is fine while callingBuild quality is also good, it's light weight... The earplug cable could be a little better, I mean qualiry wise.Overall a very good product",4
"Overall is Good at this price , super base quality super battery backup but built quality not super but okay at this price, boat working very well.",5
"I got surprised after listening through it.Awesome bass, with good look and magnetic slit.You will feel like you are in front a dj and your legs will automatically start moving on the beat.Guy,s don't hesitate, just go for it.You will never find a product like this.Just Rs.999 with fully loaded features.",5
Overall it' s good product however when you using continuously your ear starts paining n ear grip is also not good which I felt ...otherwise it's a good product.,4
"Excellent product sounds quality is very good , bass 🔊 is perfect thank you flipkart",5
"Superbly amazing in just 899 (1199).. perfect sound, totally it's all great experience",5
"Best product under 1000 ! sound quality is clear as well as good looking, easy to use and remove ,overall nice product .",5
The earphones look decent and have average built quality.They do produce good bass but the clarity is sort of average.Overall I would say spend 200 or 300 more and get the Boat Rockerz 255 or JBL inifinity.,4
Its a great product from boat. You should go for it. Its amazing in this price. I Love it,5
I using boult Curve for last 8 months and his sound was awesome and connectivity is very poor and this boat 235v2 connectivity is awesome and fast charging is cool,4
What a marvelous product. I never had a chance to use boat products before. Bass is awesome and the sound quality is like thunderstorm. My rating is 100%,5

Microphone of this Bluetooth headset is problematic. When we receive call person talking with us can't hear properly. And tha game is started of hello hello and hello...Faulty headset given by boAt..Replace it now only.,1
I own both the boat rockers 235 and boAt 235v2 and I can say that the sound quality of 235v2 is soft and clear but it lacks the punch that boat rockers 235 has. Morever it is a bit heavier then the boat rockers 235 making it little uncomfortable for a long use. Better Is however exceptionally good. The range is not taht much of a improvement and the most annoying thing I experienced is that it gets disconnected very quick and most of time when I connect it with my laptop will only connect and...,1
So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)The...,4
Its an awesome product.But if you are going for this to play games then you must not. It gets a sound delay.Overall its sound quality is immersive.Microphone need to be improved. The voice sound gets reduced when in call.,3
Overall okay in this price range. I got it for Rs864. Call vibration is plus point.,5
Earlier I gave 5 star rating to this product but after using few days it stopped working . Don't purchase total waste of money..,1

"The only big problem is it has almost no noise cancellation. So if you are looking to buy them for calling, it might be a big pain. A dog barking at  atleast 50 mtr would be clearly audible to other person on call and thus creating big nuisance while talking.",3

I've never charged it for more than 30 minutes and it stays live whole day. 3. Sound quality is good, not the best. 4. Latency is there. So if you're planning to play online games like COD Or PUBG it'll get you killed. Expect a minimum 1 second delay.5. Phone calls won't be private anymore, you'll need to speak louder than usual in order to make conversations ...",5
Sound is good. Battery backup is amazing. Got it for 999. Satisfied. Design can be improved.,5

Very poor product. None of the buttons are working except the function of powering on. Even it's unable to power off also.,1
"I was happy with the purchase at a price of 899. But, completely disappointed as it started misbehaving from day 3 onwards. The MFB and other two buttons stopped working most of the times.

This is such an amazing headsets... But i shop it for pubg gaming and for gaming it's useless... There is a huge sound lag between sceen on going and audio receiving.. that's why I'm giving 3 stars,3

Best,5
Nice,5
Product is good. I got It for Rs 999/-. As of now I am giving 3 stars for following reasons. The radius area for blue tooth connectivity is only 6 meters not 10 meters as they claim. Secondly the ear phone cables are very short and thin which makes you to feel uncomfortable when you wear. boAt needs to improve the design.,3
Worst products ever seen Please don't buy.It is having low built quality.Not at all water proof.Not even 5 meter rangeIt's true review I have returned it in 4 days.Please don't buy,1

In this product there is the vibration issuewhich will make you irritate and there is no solution for it. It is the inbuilt feature of this product. The main thing is if you are in a call and one more person call you at the same time then the other person who is talking with you will get so much noise due to the vibration issuethis is only problem with this product. So I recommend you not buy this product at all.,1
excelent product... battery backup awesm...the delivery broo  is good behaving,5

"Everything is Good Only Bass is Little bit Less as compare to Boat Rockerz 255But Except Bass Overall Is Awesome And the most amazing Function is Auto connect, when separate ear buds from each other it's connect automatically with previousaly connected device within 2-3 secon. Battery backup is also good as They commit. 10-12 Hr And. fast Charging. The  most Attractive Design which looks Too good with premium Material and Comfortable Ear Buds. Go for it.",4

"I'm a music producer and I find this earphones good but it's not worth the price, you can choose one plus instead or infinity by jbl for crystal clear sound quality, real me buds is loud cause of the driver (11.2) but it's not clear and you'll get a head ache after using it for a while , they say it has good bass but it doesn't , if you want good bass and clear sound of each and every instrument, go for one plus, jbl , infinity, skull candy or sony.

It's a very nice headset with great bass and treble delivery with a nice build quality and it's so light that one cannot feel it after putting around the neck.

I m writing this review after 2days of extensive use of this product. I find a lot of good things like its design and build quality believe me it is in this segment like its flexibility and black yellow combination matches your outfits. Coming to its sound quality it is smooth for all kind of musics but a little bit higher bass makes odd sometimes i think this is negligible. And last its battery back up after receiving this product i first go for charging and make it full of charge and coming...,5

Sounds quality is quite interesting, initially I was a bit disappointed as I usually use Sony MDR-XB450(they sound phenomenal) but comparing...",4
I would just say one thing... This is perfect neckband earphone... Quality is top notch and bluetooth connectivity is next level and believe me it really has very good bass..

I am writing this comment after 6 months of using this device and I'm glad to buy this everything in this was way better than other bluetooth headsets  Only one thing which was good but not best was the bass.

Very decent quality headphone.Pros...Stable and fast bluetooth connection.Sturdy build.

NOT BUILT FOR PUBG. battery backup is very good but sound quality is just normal. this is not build for very good sound lovers. design is also good and magnet saves battery. bad thing is its sound quality. so not recommended for high quality sound or very good quality.,2
I'm posting this after 2 week of usage first i want  tell you music quality is very muchthis comes with magnetic power On / Off  no other separate switches for power . i think ie an important feature in it . easy connect to phone no laging issues extra volume is available for  u  5⭐Battery backup is extremely terrible about  5 ⭐An standard bass better than sony Wc 300 & boat rockers 225 F im using these types 5⭐noise cancellation is very important in it im using it while im travelling i...,5
"Review after 1 month of using...1. Good for bass.2. Good for music and calling.3 Not Good for Gaming( Audio lag present)4.Charging is very good.5. Bluetooth works perfectly and fastly.6. Value for money.7. Better than Mi Neckband. ( after using both)8. Very Comfortable.9. Easy to turn off and turn on.(by direct contact of back  panels of earbuds)10. Clear Audio, noise cancellation and the range of Bluetooth is very good.",5
nice Device but it need some improvement Bass is not as expecting and 1800 not worth of 1800Rs.i have got just 1 Rs so at 1Rs Price point Nice device,3
One of the best options to pick a good quality neckband under 2k.. packs a powerful sound experience with its 11.2 mm driver and also has a decent base to couple with. Battery backup is coming for 9-11 hrs of continuous usage. It's very light weight and sweat proof as well.. Build quality is good too and great to include magnetic buds which can auto connect and disconnected. Easy to give 5 stars for it sound richness and batter performance!!,5
Excellent Bluetooth earphone.In this price point it is really awesomeThe build quality is great Sound quality is also very good with the moderate bass.specially I want to tell about the battery backup its just Accept this yellow colour everything I like about this earphone.,5
"Bass and sound quality not as per the promised standard. The build of the product is good and easy to use on the go. No cover on the charging point. But its sweat proof, so its ok. All in all, better then 'boat' in this range. Its a budget option in Bluetooth headsets.",4
Premium Headphones. Great sound quality. But bass is little less then Boat 255.  But enough bass is there. Sound is clear. Battery life is Amazing.  10 11 hours easily. Type C port would have been great. Charges fast. Built is very premium.  Magnet also works as on off switch. Bt 5 so range is great. Good product. Little expensive but great.,5
"The next popular headset!This is am awesome headset in all ways.There are some few qualities which apart from the features makes it a wonderful experience.1. The on-off feature synced with the magnet connection is fast and handy.2. The after-paired connection music is great unlike other headsets which either has a man or woman saying that it is connected.3. On max increase of volume, most headsets pauses/beeps/or a voice says full volume. This is truly annoying, however in the realme he...",5
awesome sound clearity... excellent bass... amazing battery backup... value for money product.... I'm in love with it!!🥰🥰,5
best bass and also good looking light weight feel and stylish .great battery life pros best bass better battery nice functions at that price premium looks cons slightly trebles must be increased if its increase then unbeatable earphoneslooking to buy recommend you to buy without thinking 😍👍😉,5
amazingly wonderful. best part it automatically gets connected to a paired phone when we plug it in ears. Bass is not very high but good for ears. very comfortable and battery backup is also decent. though i have used it for 4 days only but overall performance is very good.,5
clear sound and rich bass really nice balanced sound on this price,5
"Comparing it with the oneplus bullet wireless z bass edition this one is better at treble,midtones and build quality.Bass is adequate not overpowering.Literally the best under 2k after oppo m31.Charging speed is pretty above average but the backup is 10+ hours easy.",5
Design and build quality is excellent voice sound is very good but not as premium as oneplus bullets but bass is very good the next thing is battery backup which is above average but charging time is slower if you use at full volume battery backup is around 9 to 10 hours if you want very quick charge and best battery backup go for oneplus bullets but they were costlier than these. My rating is Build Quality and Design 4.5/5Sound Quality 4/5Bass 4.5/5Battery Backup 4/5Charging Time 3...,5
Its nice bt the sound quality is not best because mi wierd headphone sound is 2% better than it...its looks osm and the magnetic control works perfectly in every phn,4
Using this product for the past 2 weeks.. The battery backup is perfectly fine. Goes for two days with internment use and full one day for continuous use.. Although the bass is not good but the music sound is high. Recommend if u want more battery than good quality music,4
"Writing this review after two months of use, first of all thanks to flipkart for faster and safe delivery. Product is good, bass and treble are also very good at this price sagment. Battery backup is also good and connectivity is also good but have some prons.1. Sometimes laga to connect blutooth.2. There are no next or previous options for track change. Only chane the volume by + or -.3. Earbuds quality should be improved as eartips are not much fixed as samsung level u.",4
this product is awesome Very good sound qualityGood battery backup and works for 12 hrsGood bass alsoFlexibleVery good bt connectivty upto 10 meters Connected very fast within 4-5 secondsUSB cable is also provided6 months warranty also given by realmeSo don't see the price Just go for this productThis is realme's best product over others Best among bt headphones over all companiesAlso best among wired headphones.,5
"I had brought the realme buds and had used it for a month now and the product is good. The very plus point of this product is its battery backup which lasts for 2 days fory usage and easy to pair and even Handel.The design is also very good and the rubber neck grips in very nicely around the neck.I use to use a wired headphones which was a very uncomfortable, but now this wireless bluetooth headset had been a best part of my recent time. Being a music lover I liked the bass effect and ...",4
Awesome sound quality and powerful bass. Battery backup is also good. Nice product from realme and Thank you flipkart for this lovely product. 😍,5
"Not best but good as wireless,,,,, low and mids are good , highs are less ,,,, Bluetooth range is just fine,,,, ok for calling,,, some time Siri doesn’t respond,,, overall good product,,, could be better",4
.  Amazing sound quality and bass.  Battery is also long.  Looks awesome too.  Magnetic On and off is also fast.  Neck band and ear buds are comfortable,5
"I have used over many ear phones this one is really interesting of its automatic battery on and off with its magnetic lock which extends the battery  life and , to tell about battery life it's simply superb , where as when it comes to design the neck band is having Flexible rubber sweatproof band which is very worth buying the product",4
Good quality and sound is super sometimes not sound . LFS RTS magnetic attached . Ear bud remove the separate buds  next connected the continuous working fine ...so wireless is very good,4
Sound quality design and battery Backup is very good thank you flipkart for on time delivery and also thank you realme for good quality wireless buds. I want to says that increases trust on you flipkart and realme for a providing good and believable products,5
"I bought these headphones after seeing the ratings on flipkart but as per advertised and priced in Rs 1799/- this headphone does not have a full bass and clear sound. If you are like to listen songs in full voice with bass you will not be able to accept this headset.I liked this headset because powerful battery life, premium design, seamless connection with magnetic fast pair technology and auto on off features. But really not satisfied for bass sound.",3
"The bass is amazing and has a partial noise cancelling feeling but the vocals in a music are a bit affected by  the bass but its fine, not a big deal.Coming to the built quality its pretty good and flexible and the only problem i saw was that there is no covering on the charging port so if water goes in it might turn out to be problem.OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS WORTH THE MONEY(under 2000).Best for Hip Hop and EDM",5
It has awesome sound and everything u need when u are in mood. Its megnatic on off feature is very easy to use and makes connections faster u don't have to press a button to turn it on or off.The battery backup is awesome One must buyValue for moneyWorth buyingDesign is killing,5
Nice pair of earphones .. doesnt have the bass ... but overall it has good crisp sound and can be really loud.. which is good wile travelling in noisy environment,5
Awesome headphoneBattery backup is really good almost 10 hrs.Bass is too good and nice build quality.,5
"After 24 Hours of Uses.Approx 5 hours I used it with 70% volume because it's too loud and clear bass, battery level is now available 60%. I think it's best feature is battery backup. And other important thing is that bluetooth range is good, I can walk on Terris when my mobile in charging point in my room. Everything is good. Another good experience with it that it's magnetic switch off and on. No worry to loose battery backup with it's magnetic switch.",5
"This is the best Bluetooth headset you can buy.Quality of the earphones is top notch.Battery life is insane. I'm a heavy user, using 8 to 10 hours a day. I charge it once in 2 days, lasts 10+ hours of continuous music.Bass is great. Vocals/conversations are 8 out of 10.They are comfortable because of the magnetic style. Pairing is superb fast. Just separate the magnets from each other and it pairs.",5
"Great product, Base is too good also sound quality is too good, battery backup is outstanding...!But buttons was not easy to press. and its response slowly.",5
I like this sound much more than. The sound quality & bass and the most highlighted feature its battery backup.I have used many headfones but did not find any experience like this. Thank You Flipkart For Fast Delivery,5
"Really awesome, After using Samsung Level U this my another wireless headphones. The specifications what's are all given to there is all right. Awesome sound, true bass and light weight. I appreciate to all of you,if you want to buy just go for it. It's really great for everyone.",5
AWESOME I AM IMPRESSED  BY SOUND QUALITYNICE BATTERY BACKUPNICE MAGNETIC  CONNECTIVITYNICE DESIGN AND NICE BUILT QUALITYVERY COMFORTABLE IN EAR,5
Great service provided by Flipkart even in lockdown.Everything is good except bass quality is not that much good.The amazing feature is when magnet is connected then earphone & bluetooth will automatically turn off.,5
"As budgets bluetooth headsets come this one gains level on the top spot. Good sound quality and bass. Comfortable wear, excellent design and quality. Battery backup and magnetic way of power on and off is amazing.Superfast delivery and good packing. Go for it friends its worth it.",5
It has amazing bass .. Design is quite impressive but not the yellow color... It will better if realme add a full black color.,4
An excellent piece of tech from realme with an amazing battery life and build quality. Iam writing this review after one month of usage and I found the sound quality  good👍 (not excellent but defenitely better than most of the Bluetooth devices out there).The commendable thing about these headphones is it's backup🔥🔥.I used to get almost 8-9 hrs backup on complete with continuous usage which makes it the best backup Bluetooth device. The bass is good and punchy👍 (not too high not too low)...,5
"on and off with magnets, thats sooo handy and battery 12 hrs easily, sound quality is good, bass is right where i wanted it to be but other people may not like it, toootallly worth the money, and yeah there is a millisecond lag with PUBG or COD or any other such games.",5
"Sound is balanced Unlike the boat 255f its bass and treble, ups, mids and lows are very balancedI've used both the boat and realme, boat is good if it cist u 999 but under 3000 realme buds wireless is the best collerd headphone u can buy",5
Excellent headphone. So light weight. Super fitting ear buds. You can't even feel that you have wear somthing in your ears. Battery back up is great too. I am in love with it.,5

"I got my brand new realme wireless Budds on yesterday.super fast delivery by flipkart.sound quality is more than we expecting and built-in quality looks awesome.bass is nice and is competing with the quality of sound,but little bit less compared to boat Budds.Overall it's an outstanding purchase and I suggest those who looking for wireless Budds pricing below 2000.",5
I can't believe this it's amazing bass Super Bass quality and worthfull for this product it's really very good product I love realme headphones,5
I bought this headphone in a view of the feature it has which ensure it automatically disconnect once u join the magnetic headphone buds.It is a very useful feature in ur day to day use also improves battery lifeComing to sound quality I am also using Boat 255 and Sony Wi 200 but it has very pleasant sound profile and i can continue for 4-5hrs continuously.I can say currently its a best one and we can go for it.,5
Realme is best and best coz it's Awesome sound quality and money value great job realme keep going and give me more and best,4

Best earphone with best sound quality and awesome battery back up... Trust me its worthy every penny......many fake reviews may come but I truly suggest this product.... Awesome product by realme...,5
"For value of money this is good product and battery backup is good ,but sounds basically bass is little bit down.otherwise this is good don't doubt,buy it.",5
"Best budget wireless buds. I am a Sony fan when compared to the Sony headphones this is kind of let down on the bass. Rest of the audio is brilliant. Before this I ordered boat 225F I guess, which had only 3 hours of backup with movies and calls. With this I get more than a day usage which I am happy with. This also has battery saver with auto disconnect and connect when not in use or when the buds magnet kick in.",4
Awesome just received and sound is good Calling also good nice product,4
"it's very good products, Bass is very goodMind blowing its amazing good sound quality battery backup is very good",5

"very good eraphone. i liked the earphone very much, its bass is very good. sound quality is best compared to other eraphone it's very good. some earphones have the bass quality such that the ear starts ache but applying it does not cause ear pain at all. very soft and goods quality bass and battery backup is also good, that's why I would say the best eraphone is within 2k, that's all l, the rest is up to you what you like",5
this is beyond expectation #realme_products are just awesome for a music lover like me sound quality is perfect 👌👌,5
Using it since 5 day. Everything is good about this product be it sound quality or build quality. The battery backup is excellent too as mentioned by the company. Worth buy.,5

"Simply awesome product.Bass is good not great.Build quality is good & magnetic on-off,pairing features is just awesome.You will definitely love this realme product.",5
"Excellent headset at this price range I must say. Bass is tremendously punchy but vocals are not that good like of JBL headsets' and ofcourse they charge you twice or even more for that. Hence if you are on a tight budget no need to think twice, just go for it.",5
"Good product awesome design, good battery life, and fast delivery by flipcard",5
"Good product for good price, sound really good , bass & tone well balance , battery nice , good job Realme.",4
"awesome one. you can buy it without doubt. feels good on ear n look nice also. looks premium and built in quality is also good. I got this one jst paying 1 rupees,. Bt am not saying in that still it's a good one of the best in that price range",5

This is really a very good earphone then all the wireless earphones in this price segment and the battery backup is really good i use it for 2 days then also battery is there my earphone i really like it the bass is quite less but awesome,5
"After searching for many days I found a Bluetooth headset which fullfills all aspects needed by a person in his/her daily routine life. Delivery is on time, thanks to flipkart. After using approx 2 weeks I am writing my reviews about the product first of all we discuss about the positive aspects- :- Product quality is very good, the band is very flexible and of very good quality.:- Sound quality is awesome, bass and sound clearity is nice.:- Battery backup is outstanding for a person who g...",5
"Rating:4.75/5.    Excellent Value for money!!Comfort and Build Quality: 5/5Build quality is the best in this price range. I am writing after having also used OnePlus bullets Z, and I can say you that build quality of realme is just better. While all other options in this range including OnePlus have a predominantly plastic build, this one has metallic build of titanium alloy and just feels compared to the competition. Is best among all earphones below 2.5k!! Also it is very comfortable with...",5
"My primary usage and purpose of buying these is for calls during the Covid WFH season; Before the purchase, I was sceptical on various aspects like the capabilities of the mic, will my voice be clear, Will the background noise be amplified, Battery Backup, comfort in ear by fitting  Sound clarity and finally is it a worth the moneyFrom my experience in the last 10 days, i should say all the above boxes are checkedYes, the headset does a brilliant job while taking calls, i connect them to...",4
Best in class 11mm drives just provide a loving experience.Go for it without any doubt Bass bestBattery backup gajab h bilkul gajabSound best Best neckband in this range even better than jbl,5
"It is balanced headset for me .It has good sound quality and built quality. Packaging was good and if you want a good headset go for it , I can assure you it will not disappoint you at all and also I am using it for whole day since it arrived .",5
"After using the product for almost a month I came to the following conclusions;1. Product build is awesome, fit comes in 3 sizes, good for all ear types.2. Range as mentioned.3. Sound quality is good, if not best. But what more can you expect in 1-2k range Bluetooth earpieces.4. Latency is an issue. 5. Doesn't support AptX or adaptive plugin. 6. Battery backup is as mentioned. 7. Bass is not up to the mark. Nevertheless you enjoy crystal clear sound.Overall, I would rate it 4 stars. ...",5
Its Good.Pretty decent sound. Good bass. Battery Back Up is around 8 hrs. A treble note is seems more enhanced which might be be annoying during prolonged use.Fir those who confused between Realme Buds and One plus Wireless Z If you want a balanced clear sound without much bass and Long battery back up( *around 18 hrs) go for Wireless. But if you are a lover of decent headset with good bass  go for Realme,4
THIS Buds is awsome . Nice product such as beautiful. main best feature is battery back up & sound .charging time is 1hr30min battery standing time is 2 days maximum. Your continuesly listening music 1/2  day gaurrantee . Magnetic music controlling feature is good.Its very good product love this product thank you Realme. & flipkart m,5
The sound quality noice free experience easy connectivity and power off build quality look are the best of the product.. It does not have a minimum bass you can't enjoy songs with good bass.  While calling having trouble with mic connectivity.Some connectivity problems occuring .    1 sec late of sound in PUBG doesn't give you good gaminig experience .. It comes with a 8-9 hrs battery backup .Supports in a 10 meter diatance from device .,4
"Please click a like if u like the reviewPros1)Built quality it's really very nice.2)Sound is very loud and clear.50%  sound is enough for dailly uses3)Must try Allen Walker songs they are amazing4)It's not too light weight or heavy .Small cables feels premium5) Money you spend definitely get it's valueCorn1)V shape sound signature sometimes feels too heavy2)If you looking for natural clean sound ,it's not for you.Sound magic 10c Skullcandy buds 2 will definitely produce better sou...",4
"It's a gadget for which I have a mixed feeling. Don't doubt about it's quality, durability and reliability, it's great in those departments. But the only thing which I wish could've been better is the latency. It's almost 1 sec after which the sound is heard(some times it's less than a sec). Other than that, it's other features such is the magnetic on-off function works fabulously. Overall, if you're not into gaming a lot like PUBG, Free Fire, Call Of Duty, etc., It's a perfect pair of wirele...",5
"I bought this headset especially for the music and I was kind of skeptical while placing the order, but after listening to music with this headset, I was so much impressed by the sound quality, this headset sounds as good as normal wired headsets, I couldn't find any difference in my honest opinion. I can't comment about battery backup as I am not a too heavy user. I generally listen to music approximately for 1 hour and 1 hour for YouTube so found the battery backup adequate for any normal u...",4
Thats really a good and value for money Bluetooth headset. The best part is its long battery life and also if get disconnected went both the magnet get connect.Really satisfied with the product,5
"Ya it's really good Bluetooth headset, I'm happy to buy this product infact before buying this I'm also confused about bluetooth handset..... which is perfect for me, but now I'm satisfied with that.....👍👌Vicky Choudhary 😊",5
this earphone is good. the charging time is company claim one and half hour but they have fully charged in 2 hours in my testing.this earphone battery backup is good thank you Flipkart. Thank you real me. i loved it. 😀😀😀,5
"Its too overrated. The magnetic on /off and seamless connection is very awesome. But buttons, charging port cover etc are better on boat rockerzz. Using it and ican feel sound is much clearer in realme but boat 225f has a punchier bass.",3
"Bass is not that great as hyped and promised it's ok ish, Mi bluetooth has a better base than this one in terms of bass trebble but good job done in design and features it offers i mean the build quality is good and feature like magnetic play and pause or switch make it easier to operate this, if features is what you wan't and can compromise on audio a bit than go for this one or audio quality is what you need than go for MI Bluetooth wireless.",3
One in all earphones....great sound quality with enhanced thump of bass....In good price ...Battery and overall build design and functionality is also awsum.....Only the thing missing in here is the dedicated chamber for mic and volume buttons like One plus Z bullets....But it doesn't make that difference still...Overall Hi-Fi earphones with premium sound quality and supreme bass effect...,4
Price is cheaper according to product... Really a good work by realme... Beast in class very impressed with battery performance nd sound is also very decent... Overall I want to give 4 out of 5... Highly recommended ****,5
Vry good headset nice sounds adn clear voice and best off and auto on off vry nice technology,5
"Balanced and soulful sound output. Sound is sweet and pleasant, not to bass boosted. Battery could have little better. Design is also good, sleek and stylish. Green colour is surely an attention drawer. Go for it.",4
"After using it fron last 2 weeks, now I can say that is it one of the best.Sound quality is great and works awesome during calls.Best feature is having magnetic buds. They are easy to carry and once you attach both buds magnetically, it immediately turns off. During calls, it takes 1-2 seconds to connect automatically as soon as I detach both ear buds.",4
"Superb headph with evenly matched high,low ,mids , elegant design and slim shaped comfortable with your neck but disappointed with ear comfort as it pains if u put in ears continuously for a hour",5
"Very nice Buds in this price rangePros..Powerful driversheavy baseGood battery backupComfortableCons..-Mids and highs lack a bit, they're satisfactory but not great-Earbuds are huge and sometimes hurt my ears olong usage (I'm using the smallest size tips)-Instrument separation is not great-Charging is not fastOverall these are very nice earbuds in this price range, I strongly recommend then if you are prefer heavy base in your music.",5
"Great build, easy to connect, great sound dynamic range, connectivity over long range is pretty nice...overall best for the price.... Highly satisfied",5
this produt is very good enough with sound quality.it has a punchent base.calling clarity is also good.i am just saying by using it in 1 day. it is a worthy product.thank you realme for it.,5
"It's really good. Anybody who needs to quickly switch on and off thier earphones, it's a perfect choice. It looks better in person than in those photos.Pros:-Really intuitive to use-Good sound quality-very comfortable and light weight- impressive fast chargingCons:-no manual off button",5
Overall a good quality earphones with awesome sound...lag while watching movies and other YouTube videos is minimal and you can't notice it...but there is a lag of about 1 sec while playing games..build quality is also great...connection is good and it lasts for 8-10 meters...battery backup is nice with average of 10-12 hrs,4
Earphones have performed as per expectations after a months usage. The auto switch off after connecting earphone pods is one of the best and unique feature. Battery backup is not up to the mark but very well lasts throughout a normal 10 hr work day. The middle button for receiving calls could have been designed better. Not ideal for gaming as lag of 1-2 secs is seen.,4
"A very good product with little higher price. Happy with the product sound and battery backup runtime. I have charged only once in last 10 days and I am using  everyday at least one hour to 2 hours. The wire length from speaker to neckband is very short, less than 6inch. I was expecting longer length as shown in product advertisment. overall a good experience",4
Very nice and easy to connect but the yellow wires are very vibrant and  fills like a toy earphone. The mic in not that much effective and has no noice cencelation . Company should work on  this two points. # 🔋 battery is good # easy to connect# good sound quality . Good fiting.,4
Very comfy and durable design. Better than the oneplus and mi neck band. Thank you flipkart and realme.,5
This is the first bluetooth headphone I'm using. Purchased after a lot search and reviews. Better than boat and cheaper than samsung and sony. U will get the good sound quality and the better power management. Just go to it,5
This product is too good quality is very good with this price this is a best deal thank you for Flipkart give me the such a nice product,5
"Look like Sporty....awesome look and fit. Sound quality 5/5. Bass lover go through blindly. Battery like when use to burn it. Otherwise relaxed from battery life. Two earbuds magnetic system power on/off. Google assistant by one click. Reject/answer call, volume up down clicking one touch...overall good performance. Thanks Realme",5
Very good in this price range Looks cool and stylish Audio quality superb 👌👌,5
"This was my last shopping with Chinese products but about product realme it have mind-blowing sounds quality everything is perfect just awesome n at last thanks Flipkart fast n genuine products services, a i enjoyed shopping  ever time",5
Quite good actually... sound quality is very decent. U can enjy it by listening songs almost whole day long.  U dont hav to charge it twice a day. Bass iss good in full sound.  Noice cancellation iss very good. When u ll talk to someone opoosite person cant hear the other sound so its pretty good in this case. Overall its a goood product.,5
"1. The sound output is good alongwith bass2. Noise cancellation is on point when you are indoors 3. Pairing is very fast 4. Bluetooth range is very good 5. The ear support could have been better as continuously wearing          it for long stretches becomes a bit uneasy 6. The battery support well is not that apt as promised by the brand. No, it does not last for 12 hours.7. Its very light and it does not weigh upon your neck even if you wear it for long stretches 8. It does not feel i...",5
It's really super. It's base and sound quality is really good and awesome 👌. It's battery life is too long when it changed for about 10 to 15 minutes then it can go for 2 to 3 hours continually.I liked because it's deigine and build quality are really good.,5
"These are pretty great ,i got it for my sister and she loved it though get the oneplus wireless z ones if you have oneplus phone,they are better with their phones.",5
"Nice Bluetooth, it comes with decent look. It provides you very good quality of sound I really like it.",5

"I'm gonna give it 5 out of 5.Believe me i was thinking that it will not be the best choice but it became the best choice in 2000 price range,everyone should go for it..believe me it will give u a super bass..control system is awesome,design is awesome,sound quality is excellent,outstanding,fabulous..Battery backuo is perfect.You shouldn't buy oneplus bullets z earphone because that's giving low latency only for oneplus mobiles ; not in any ither brands..and the wrap charge technology is als...",5
"Best quality u get in this price range .. built quality, sound very good ... Noise cancellation present but not too strong ... Bass weakly... EDM good to hear ...sweatproof ... Worth the money for sure 👌 ... Enjoyed the purchase .. recommend to buy this ..👍🏻",5
"Quality Is Good And Sound Is Awesome But Sometimes It Won't Work I Don't Know Why For Example When I Connect This Earphone To My Phone And If I Pause Everything Like Music,Video For Minimum 15 Minutes Then It Won't Work Again We Have To Connect It Then After  Only It Will Work",5
Accept bass all ok... Main thing is battry backup which is excellent and the magnetic control it's very unique. If u r a bass lover don't buy it. And if u like well balanced sound go for it.,5
"Its the best in this price range. Bass from this headset is just average,  could have been better. Connectivity and built is excellent with good battery life. Go for it.",4
"Not good for PUBG gaming, I bought this for gaming but this is 1 second delay(1000ms). Not recommend for gaming at all. Otherwise sounds quality is good",3
It's not good as I expected but if you have no more options then you can buy it It's has no comfort in ear size of neckband is small Realme is not too good in all it's products I think they should work hard on products quality Over all ok not too good,3
"Wow just one word for this earphone wow i love its sound quality design, built quality and lastly battery life offcourse man this this work like champ.. thanks to Realme for such a nice product at such a affordable price..",5
"Good quality products ! Sound is awesome , U can go for it . Best in this price segment.",4
"Pleased with the built , rubber is made of good quality material, earbuds and battery compartment have metallic finish , magnet is super effective , and bass is of premium quality, calling quality is very clear and translucent.",5
"Good Bluetooth in budget im using this since 10 days But receiver(mic) is not good while playing pubg and it is good in calling,music & movies and bass and volume is good and noise cancellation is not up to the mark when compared to apple lighting connector,battery back is so so good its been coming 1-1/2days with single charge i like itOverall good product,money worth",3
Sound quality is good .... If you want balance sound then this is not for you.... Only bass lover....Bluetooth range is excellent and for pubg there is little microsecond delay When you wear ... Yellow wire look like golden chain.,5
The best Headset at this price point Build quality is so good 5/5 for the battery back up 2 hrs charge can give u more than 12 hrs backup The sound quality is also good But 3/5 for the bass Over all its the worth for money Love realme❤️,5
"Value for money. When I bought it , I wanted something like a sony product But I could not find a reliable review at a price below 5000. Then I took a risk so as to say at that time. But it appears that it was worth the risk. So far so good. Will ret back to you if I have a different opinion little later.1. Sound quality good2. Easy operations.3. Good blue tooth range. But, ear buds are little misfit for the ear. It tends to come out while running. The comfort of a snugly fitting ear p...",5
U know I'll tell y  i liked this product bcz ..u don't need to press the button and all like other brands.. there is a magnetic on buds if u just bring close each other it's off State.. if u remove it back thn ita on state.. it just need a sec to connect ..i had used other barnd too it needs time to connect and we have to hold the button long time ...in this product it's not like that... Just fabulous product 👌❤️,5
The buds and it's sound clarity is Awesome but the bass was not too good. The build quality is Super Fabulous and the magnetic feature. Just go for it.,4
Very Beautiful product I love it sound is very clear love it thanks Flipkart for fast delivery,5
"It has a stylish looks and great design. Audio quality is very good and bass is good enough but the battery back is really great, on a 50-60% volume it last for around 10.5 hours and this 10.5h was not continuously played it was calculated in 3 days(playing now and then).Overall its worth the money.",4
Really good device new but trust worthy. Good sound quality for reasonable price.,5
"Review after using it more than 6 months,1. Sound quality is as expected.2. Design and quality of material they have used for build buds and rubber material which completely fits in your ears easily.3. Battery backup is most important things in this kind of headset and realme buds is on excellent level of battery backup.4. I am more attracted by its magnetic functionality and it is working as more expected way such as connection create with phone and suddenly disconnected from phone.",4
"Seriously guys there has been only pro's....1)sound quality r too good with deep bass.2) built quality and tough metireal has been used.3) Awesome battery life with last long.4) One n off feature r too good, without any hesitation",5
Reviewing after a week of usage It has a wonderful bass and rich highs. Audio quality is superb in every aspect. Fast 6 seconds zero touch pairing.*If you want to operate 1 or more devices with this without any hassle spend ₹200 more and buy a ONEPLUS BULLETS WIRELESS Z*Definitely not for *PUBG* playersBest thing that they are tuned by ALAN WALKER so if you are an EDM fan just go for it,4
Really awesome earphones. Sound quality is so great that I can compare it with my Apple wired earphones. I usually ride bike and two wheeler so I wanted an earphones by which I can make and receive calls on two wheelers easily and without any disturbance. These buds allows crystal clear sound during calls. They are easy to use and very handy. Thank you realme for this awesome product.,5
Product is Verry Good Sound Quality Is verry good Bass Its Good But Not extraordinary,5
It's really good but one more thing that sound quality means in music on base its little bit low...All over it's good better than level u,5
"Great for the price but better alternative available at same price, for ex OnePlus Wireless Z. Its not bad, its just not better.",3
Writing this review after 6months of daily usage.Pros:1. Good Battery life2. Very good Bluetooth range3. Call quality is good4. Build quality is very good5. Sound quality is good if u like normal baseCons:1. Buttons is not properly places. 2. Single colour available. (Only yellow),5
1st day review feedback :- flipkart is very fast delivery.- sound quality is good specially in music but little low in calls- battery backup is excellent so far- charging is also so far good.Thanks.,4
Call quality is not as good as expected. It has just been a few days since i bought this one and their is some unwanted noise from right bud while calling . Bass is good and battery back up is nice as well.,3
Pro:1.Battery back up is awsome2.Bass is good3.Looks trendy and good design4.Smart connectCons:1.Sound is a liitle unpleasant when listening at higher volume bt at below 75 percent its ok. 2.Auto on/off/connect feature is good bt sometimes sound plays on phone insted of headset after autoconnect.Overall good headset to have,4
I'm writing this after 1 month of use. 1. Quality of material is good. 2. Bass is good only at high volumes. At low volume there is no bass. 3. It fells very heavy in ear because of the heavy magnets in earpiece. 4.Charging time is 1:30 hours. It lasts upto 12 hours at 50-60% volume5. Connectivity is excellent due to 5.0 Bluetooth version. But use it with mobile that has a 5.0 Bluetooth version.6. Overall i wanna give 3 out of 5. IF U NEED A EARPHONE FOR LONG USE DON'T BUY IT AT ALL GO...,3
In this price range it is one the best that you can buy. I blindly trust this brand. Battery backup is just awesome and great sound quality too. Built quality also just too good,4
"Bass is pretty good but little compromised thump is here but in this size & in overall package I couldn't expect more.Highs & mids are controlled very well not piercing.Conclusion - it is one of the best neckband in all aspects. Buy it, compare it & you will definitely love it.",5
Best product... Sound quality is very good bass is also good I love this product,5
"This is super.Very good sound Very good baddBattery backup is good , almost 7 hrs.Comfortable for ear.Only noise cancelling is missing.Overall good product. And automatically on off system is extra 😍I am very happy.",5
"Product review-1)Sound- Being a general listener sound was very very good. (4/5)2)Bass-.  Bass is its main highlight. And it's true , bass is at another level in this earphone.

(5/5)Overall best earphone not only under this price range but as par with some of the best earphone in the Market.Being a general consu...",5
"Well balanced frequencies (Bass, Mid, Treble). Bass is slightly boosted but still stands out to be the best in this price range. Battery backup as promised and build quality is exceptional ! Go for it !",5
Love this....one of my fvrt...❣️I used many wireless earphone but this was the bestThe sound quality was super and the bass is lit💥If u r song lover Don't think too much just buy it...,5
"It was my first neckband and I had a very high expectations from this and it fulfilled almost every need of mine.its very convinient and has a great build quality and battery life is also very good few people don't buy it because of its brand ""realme"" as it is not a very old brand but trust me go for it",5
"Just Dont take it! Cuz everyone on youtube are doing paid reviews for this! Bass is good but its completely not compatible for using with iphones .  low,mid tones are not sufficient like if you are using iphone then its completely not compatible with your phones just dont take it",5
If I put this buds into my ear I feel like iam in heaven amazing ⚡??,5
This buds are awesome cool and fantastic. If you will see any earphone in this segment they are not feature full like this. Go with this buds they are good.,5
"I like the product quality. Sound especially the bass is ok not like Bose or Sony but good enough. IPX5 rating definitely like as I use it during exercise. Calls, no problem with quality or breakage. BT range is good.ConsLittle heavy. Also no multipoint to connected to more than 1 device. This important feature is lacking especially during working I am connected to my laptop and miss calls on my phone.",5
Iam using xperia handset and i really loved these realme wireless buds with it.Bass quality is top notch but the vocals was not up to the mark bcoz the bass was boosted here and the sound 🔊 loudness is so grt that i can't hear it on full volume. Being a bass lover i loved it and the magnet off on system saves more battery hence making it so easy to use it. The play and pause buttons are bit confusing one as they are not much highly imprinted but it won't be a problem if we use daily.It's s...,5
Awesome earphones especially the bass is awesome and design and build quality is good.. Best for the price better than oneplus bullets wireless z,5
"Amazing sound , just awesome , And very fast delivery thank you flipkart",5
Great .....super quality and good .... reasonable money ...and  Charging protection is less...means usb pin  protect not there ...and anyway good and better 4/5,4
It is awesome the bass everything but it may lag if you play online games like pubg etc like 100ms oe .1s and if your device dosent have bluetooth 5.0 if not work at its full potential. And while calling it may lag if your phone is old.,4
Everything is excellent except call quality..Battery backup: 2 to 3 days(normal use) 1 and half day(heavy use)Sound quality: excellent sound quality. Bass is good.Design and build: Simple and decent design with good build quality.Call quality: Just average,5
"Sound quality is very good. With a decent battery backup it is of course a good choice. Pros. 1. Great sound quality2. Battery backup3. Built4. ClarityCons1. Audio latency. Which affects me most.  It's not a true wireless earphone. It has a audio delay. Sometimes it's irritating. If you want to play games like pubg, don't even think about it.",4
So I have been using this headset for about 3 months now.I have purchased them mainly for workout. Even after being in contact with sweat for hours they work pretty well. Sound quality is fine not very good. In this range these buds are among the best. Battery life is pretty good and here it beats most of its competition.Easy pairing and magnetic off/on is a delight.,4
It is worth for money very good sound quality battery backup is excellent in this budget you don't get more than this really very good product,5
"It is amazing wireless bluetooth headset , very good features that realme is brought . Compared to samsung level u bluetooth headset realme is very good and battery backup is awesome and build quality also. I loved it.",5
I love it's design and build quality battery performance is good but sound quality is not so good as expected overall best in price range,4
"Overall experience is good and decent , only for game lovers like Pubg and high end games there is a sound delay in the games. Rest all is good , thanks flipkart 👊🏻👍🏻",4
It's very good I like it's colour very much it's a really very good product and it's bass quality is mind blowing sound quality is superb and battery backup is good it shape is very likely,5
Sound quality is excellent. Build quality is also good.Bass is good but they should improve a bit.Clarity is just outstanding. Magnetic on/off operation is the standout feature.Overall it's the best bluetooth headset u can buy under 2000.,5
"Best for battery and sound could be enhanced , I've returned boat rockerz and ordered this but happy with this one for battery and sound is also best.",5
"It's really superb , if the both weres r covered by a strong protection then it is more appreciated by people",5
"Best Earphones This Budget Sound Quality Awesome Good Build quality Flipkart delivered very quick within 2,3 daysCharged and Good battery backup Battery 10 hr continued plays PuBG, listening music, watching movie aslo All over Best Earphones",5
Mind-blowing sound quality. Super balanced sounds. I have a great experience with both songs and movies. Call quality is also decent. Thanks for making delivery possible in this Lockdown situation.,4
"Writing this review after 5days... Well the built quality is just wow,  u will feel a premium neckband (only buds are made up of hard plastics ).. 1-Sound quality -Its crispy and loud with the 11mm drivers.. The bass is expected and the trebles are bit high (depending upon device)The vocals during call are excellent (u can easily talk while riding ur bike with a speed of 40km/h..Opponents never complained of sounds during heavy workout. 2-Battery life -Its just wow in this segment,  com...",5
Must buy product ! It’s very comfortable in the ear even if I wear it for long.Amazing sound quality and runs for 3 days without charging. Good battery backup.Design is perfect as sometimes you don’t feel that headset is hanging in the neck.,4
"Overall sound quality is good Design looking niceNeeds to be improvement for bass,not as  required but if u chnage your equalizer from your phone setting then u can feel the little bit improvement in bass",4
Awesome amazing product automatically generated And fastest delivery. Thank you flipcart.    Delivery man is so nice person thanks,5
The audio clarity is good.If you want to have a good audio experience with normal bass than I will recommend to get this product.Mic is not efficient and people at other end find difficulties in listening.,5
One of the best earbud. Sound is awesome and battery backup is too good... I loved it ❤️...,5
Great purchase. Supremely good in battery backup of about 19 hrs on medium volume. 12 hours on full volume. High fidelity speaker drivers with rich sound. Worth the price. Just the silicone ear buds can be more soft according to me. Rugged built.,5
This is genuine product which I want to buy .Sound quality and bass is very very good .I have bought in 1799/- and I love this headset.,5
"I was looking for one with call quality and good sound this served my purpose, noise cancelation is good people on other end can hear you perfectly if you are looking for a earphone for music and especially calls, go for this one, its really a worthy purchase. I dont know about other realme products but this one really fit my tech needs thank you ❤",5
"Sound quality is good but clicking on the buttons is little bit unhappy. sometimes the middle button  can't work properly means we can't go for the next song it's pauses the song.we have to press slowly ,another problem is volume (+) button sometimes it's works sometimes not. That's it.It's worth for it's price👍",5
Best quality. SOUND is very clear and bass is awesome but battery backup is quite less than 12 hours. All over best product far better than boat rokerzz,5
"Best sound quality ever heard from a Bluetooth earphone ,bass is incredibly good ,its not like other earphones which gives massive grr sound as bass this earphone gives the real bass",4
Good battery packeup... Really like it... Good bass.... Love it,4
"11.2mm bass boost but bass is less than boat rokerz, other wise it's really amazing battery life good design",4
"I have used many earphones but this is one of the best.  It's got amazing bass and the best feature is the auto switch off and on feature. when the earphones are joined together,  the earphones turn off and when they are separated,  the turn on.  This results in long battery life.  The only drawback is the call answer button.  It is not in the best position and you need to get used to it to answer any call quickly.",5
1st of all this this is new company in India so I was worried and little bit careful before buying this .. But after seeing lots of videos and reviews on YouTube I bought this..And after using this for 2 weeks I can say this is just amazing when we talk about build quality and battery backup... I just loved itThis is best air buds at this price range... Just go for it,4
Need to improve Button position and response with sound or beep... Music control ... Ow awesome quality.. Better comfortability... Better Bass... All is good in this price....,5
"Look wise loved it, overall good product , delivered in time.. Purchased 1 week ago working good...",5
amazing bass with clear sound quality .. and convenient to use with magnetic ends that enables the switching on anf off of Bluetooth....battery life is ok,5
Backup is very goodSound quality is very goodBass is not that refined but okay.Call quality is decent but battery drains faster while using at the time of calls.Rest all is very good at the price point.,5
"I received via Flipkart but warranty card is not available inside the box -....and one more thing wire length is too long and adjustable locking not in product ...clear sound , battery backup too good better Bluetooth connection compare to otheRS",3
I have Boat 255 Wireless also at home which my wife uses..So I will do a comparison between Realme Wireless and Boat Wireless 255Bass-                   Boat is more bass heavy and Realme is balanced sound. if you like bass heavy go for BoatLength of wire - Boat is 5-6 Cm longer wires. That difference is noticeable when you turn neck to sides. Maybe important to some people.Battery and usable hours - Realme wins this because of Magnetic on off functionality. Boat is max 6 hours. Realm...,5
I am using it since one month and my reviews arePros:1. Best Form Factor2. Light Weight3. Amazing Sound Quality4. Outstanding battery backup.5. Effortless Connectivity.Cons:Bass could be better.Overall most reliable and effective product delivered by Realme.,5
"Worth of every penny spent....! 1. Battery backup is not less than 11hrs in any situation2. Bass is awesom if i compare this to giants like Boat, sony etc.3. Comfortable adjustment and best quality materials for neck design.4. Colour combination is also good but i would have preferred black wire instead of yellow in my model.",5
Nice earphones. Very good bass. The only con about this is it doesnt work well for calls. The person we are talking can hear our background sounds more than our own voice.,4
Awesome headset. Great sound and battery quality. But can be better in longer distance connectivity. Still it manages well,5
I am very satisfied 😊 with these earphones and I must say the sound quality is awesome & the quality of the product is excellent... I will recommend this to everyone... Guys go for it without hesitation.... You will not regret after buying these earphones ! ***** & Lastly Flipkart thanks for delivering my order before time !,5
The sound quality is so real that realme proved they nailed the market.thers are best wireless earphones under 3000.The bass is perfect the treble is perfect and connectivity is good with 12 hr + battery backup,5
a super product...it is absolutely a thriller...bt design should be update...neck band design is very soft and good.bt wire is not in proper postion more hanging was there..position of wire should changed,5
Awesome super best Master blast made for brands Don't think about money just enjoy qulity,5
"In first impressions you'll feel little bit less bass and low volume. But after 2-3 days you'll get use to it even max volume feels like more tha enough. And the best feature is that magnetic control, it instantly gets off and on and saves lot more battery.",4
"Definitely better than many others out in the market. The magnetic on/off technology is simply awesome and the time it takes to connect is easy. Awesome sound and bass, with great high and mid tones. Great clarity of call. No volume problems. Latency still exists for games. Nothing to do there. But overall, it is worth buying.",5
Nice purchase and not so much good in sound quality. Its decent and balanced sound.voice over phone calls are not petty  clear,4
The best bluetooth neckband earphones I hve never seen .. The sound and bass is too good.. Coming to the battery back the battery back up is awesome and it lasts for 10 hrs. I'm so satisfied with this product.,5
The most amazing earphone by realme at this budget with best bass & clear voice call. Battery backup is just amazing.  Its so light that your ear can hardly feel the earphones on the ears even after using continuously for whole day.  Also the flips are ao soft and comfortable.Thank you flipkart,5
Excellent battery backup. Good looking and stylish earphones. Music clarity is very good. Bass is above average for earphones. Overall good buy for 1599 bucks.,5
"This product is really worth its money. It is light weighted and properly fits in the ear. Good sound quality and good bass. Excellent product by ""Realme"".Thanks.",4
"very good product ... trust me it's good bass, good sound, good battery backup but designfor me can do better in future ..value for your money",4
Build quality is awesome at this price range Battery backup is excellent Not highly appreciated for bass heads Worth for the price and go for it,5
"I brought this because i have a realme phone and it has very good battery backup. There's some minor things that i dont like (it doesn't vibrates when someone calls you, you can connect only one device at a time, don't have protection on the charging port, balanced bass, doesn't had extra bass like boat headphones) but other than that it's the best nickband. Battery backup is just awesome plus it has very good charging speed. It doesn't hurt your ears. It's very comfortable to wear.",4
"I'm overall impressed with this product...It's been almost 22 days I'm using this product...Overall no complain..But still there is something u should know....PROS:- * Sound quality is above expectations *Build quality is too good*Best thing of this earphone is it's battery backup.. I have used this product almost 12to14hrs..CONS:- * Magnetic force decrease about 2% after 15day(as I felt )* Neck band is some thing felt to be short. * This one is very serious, sometimes it doesn't...",4
Amazing product by realme after using it I am writing thise review battery backup is good sound quality is awesome and built quality is also very nice if you are searching for any blutooth wireless headset just go for it.,5
Very good product.. value of money... nice sounds quality battery backup is very good  love it so much..😍😍😍,5
"I am happy with the product. Sound quality is awesome, no harm for eardrums at all as much as I have used. Sound lagging with games like PUBG. Battery back up is great. Upgradation can be sone on bass quality to make music feel to the core. Over all a thumbs up. 4.5/5, 0.5 can be earned on improved bass quality. Thank you!Happy as it is worth.",5
"Brilliant headset. Will always stick like a magnet whenever you remove them from your ears. It helps saving battery by stoping music. It's quite convenient and tidy. The levels are good, especially high bit rate songs. Good buy 👍",5
This realme buds was awesome build quality is too good and main thing battery back was too good and..... Best thing value for money not too much costly this ear phone in budget and it is good thing...🥰🥰🥰,5
"Ultimately this is the real Bluetooth headphone,I have used this headphone from last three months and I just say this is awesome,Combination of yellow and black give it a premium and cool look.And the battery backup is just god level.Also the quick charging feature work very properly in this headphone.Call quality and noise cancellation is great, this is not for gaming because sound lag is occurs , and the sound quality for song is quite good, not great.Only the thing that I don't like ...",5
"Bass is more than good. Sound quality is awesome. Comfort level is great don't feel anything hazzy. Fits to ear very well. Build Quality is good only thing I disliked that there's no protection for charging spot sweat or water can damage & call alert vibration while incoming call you must have provided it when build everything good apart from it. Magnetic on off is great way to fuction, saves a lot of battery. 2 more button if given on the left side for operating would have made operating it ...",4
Earphones are really good and have a very good battery backup. Bass is really good Sound quality is clear If you seeing forward to buy it don't bother it will stand your requirements obviously.,5
After using buds more than one month I m going to write my review.. sound pattern of dynamic drivers 11.5mm with base is awesome but not with twitters sound(like jhan jhan sound)  bettery back is very good comparatively to JBL. But one thing I note that is calling feature.. it’s worst. The mike of buds pick a lot of sound from background than my voice. Even blowing air sound heard too much to listener.,5
"Best wireless ear phone it is ...Bass is good , design is good and build quality is good",5
"Best in this price range. Awesome sound quality and bass is also good as per the  price. Build quality awesome. Battery backup insane.... 10-12 hours and supports fast charging too, full charge in 1.5 hrs.",4
Overall experience is good but while playing PUBG the synchronization is not good when i fire from gun the sound of bullet came late around 0.05 to 1 sec so it was so irritating for me.. i would recommend this product for calling and listening music but not recommend for playing games specially PUBG,4
very good product from ream me. the most amazing thing is its magnetic effect. voice quality is best and also battery back up is best. go through it. paisa vasool headphone hai bhai.,5
Actually i purchased it after watching so much comparison videos on youtube and finally i got the best one. The sound quality is awesome.Battery backup is also 5/5.Design is also 5/5.Bass is average but you will love that punchy sound.It's the best product on this range.,5
"These have excellent build quality, great battery backup, fantastic call experience (thanks to its mics). Sound quality is not top notch although bass heads will love it. Definitely not for those who are looking for the balance sound and punchy but non over powering bass. These support SBC and AAC codecs in all those android phones which have android Oreo and above. If you get this for 1499 or 1599 or anything lower then these are excellent value for money.",5
"The vocals are perfect clear.But in the case of bass we need to compromise a bit.Built quality is good but black colour will be better than yellow and give these buds a standard look.I bought this product n 24th feb 20,so after a detailed use i wil update about  the battery backup.Overall at this range, i suggest realme buds rather than anyother.Thankyou realme for this product.",5
I really love this product  I review this after a one month of using excellent sound quality bass and battery back up is excellent u blindly go for it without other option user friendly easy connect crystal clear sound quality when calling and noise cancellation is also working great product from realme ..thanks Flipkart,5
"Best for bass lovers.At this 1500 price range best bluetooth headset,If you go for more price you can find more clear sound headsets, but at this range best bluetooth headset...",5
Don't think too much just buy it if you want to listen good Music it has Good Bass And Good Sound With Quality before i purchased.I saw lots Of negative review about bass but now I can say It has Good Thump Bass and of course battery backup is also mind-blowing.,5
Over a bang for the buck. Best wireless earphone available at this price segment. Bass is phenomenal and overall build quality is great. Battery backup is decent too. Getting 8-10 hours of playback time.,5
"It's really awesome. Sound is perfect I am the person who use earphones at 100 volume but in this I use 60-70% is max for me although 100 volume on this is superb. Design quality is awesome and the magnet feature is handy, also battery backup is great♥️ Loved it",5
Battery life excellent good fitting but this color coding like yellow black some time look like not good,5
"In this price, it is a very good product.Positives: Battery is very very good, connectivity is good, Light on ears, sound is ok.Negative: Bass is not that much great like they are promoting.",4
Very good product to a very nice very fast delivery thank you your Flipkart,5
"This is one of the best wireless headphone...And the colour of this headphone is also goodI wish it would be more better if the price point would be approximately 1400-1500rs.Now let's talk about this headphone1)Sound Quality is superb, best in this price point, it's not so much good for gaming. I mean no earphones are perfect for gaming as much I've experienced.

I can suggest Proudly that realme is the best for anyone looking for good sound quality, with great battery backup and most importantly the calls. Call quality is decent in outdoors, you are required to put mic closer to your mouth in traffic, where as in home it is unbeatable at this price.Battery backup is one of the USP of this product.",4
Great sound you Love it if you like to listen old song of 90s and decent enough bass for bass boosted songs.,5
"These earphones are fantastic. The best feature that it has and it distinguishes it from other earphones of this range is the feature that it automatically turns off when you join the earbuds. Trust me, this is a really useful feature which is not present in Boat and JBL earphones of similar range. For this reason I was ready to pay some extra bucks for it. There is just one negative. Bass is not good enough. If you're looking for earphones wherein bass is your priority, these are not for you...",4
"Well just purchased these earbuds,what I have noticed so far is depicted below in Pros& consPros:-Pricing- In this price range you are not going to get anything like thisBuild- Looking at the price point it is quite decent,silicon used is of good class.Bass-The power of these earphones lies here,having 11mm driver produces rich bass.Treble-Here this earphone lacks,treble should be well optimized here.Till this point I have not noticed any distortion which can be really disturbing,there...",4
"The product is actually worth buying, it works fantastic with my phone (Oneplus 7) due to BT version 5. Sound quality is also good but do not expect a loud bass like a Sony or any other expensive models. Value for money product.",4
"Great headset under 2000 bucks!!! u might get devices with a lower price tag but the the design-built , the bass and especially that battery is too good for the money.Overall total worth of money!!",4
EXCELLENT WIRELESS REALME BUDS ARE AWESOME AND SOUND IS AMAZING AND CONNECTIVITY IS VERY GOOD AND QUALITY IS BEST,5
Writing this after 10 days of use. Sound quality is quite good and played CALL OF DUTY while using this no sound lag found. Battery backup is like 11 hours and bought this for 1600. So it was awesome deal! Build quality is very good yet i think some short of cover has to be provided on charging port for Better protection!,4
"Nice One I Love it, Bt here many of Problems when u charge the bud does nt work,,When play Pubg it Sounds Delay. The most errteting thing is Its doesn't work some time even it connected u hav to disconnect it thn connect and it work feel so bad",3
It is  wonderful amazing song quality super bass booster nice quality thank you Flipkart,4
"It's a good product in this price range...and very comfortable and easy to carry and very lightweight it is...over all its a nice product in 1600 budget...Sound quality is good but bass is not too much loud... Sound is crystal clear, And some time there is an issue with bluethooth connectivity.but over all its good",5
"Very stylish, Good for calling. Good stylish brand for girls. If u are a music lover loving bass, this is not the right brand. If u want to pubg with this, then forget about this brand. Very much lag in sound when playing pubg.",4
"What a great product.... Sound quality, battery back up, design quality is also too good.... Thank you so much Flipkart for very fast delivery.",5
Super product bluetooth connecting is very fast excellent sound quality super excellent base light weight giving 4.7 ster,5
Earbuds are awesome.I like the magnetic function.sound quality is awesome powerful bass.thing which I don't like is that it hurts some time when you put in your ear for long time l. Overall it's good at this price range.,5
"Very nice product, bass was very well balanced, it was not like overpowering nor it was baseless. I loved it, gifted it to my brother in law",5
"Without any doubt Just go for it.  I have used boat 275v2 (274v2 actually) and used this also. Realme is far ahead from boat in all aspect. Battery life 2 days in normal uses while in boat it just 5-6 hour at same uses.connectivity and call mic voice quality is much better in realme. its too easy to connect to paired device and switch another devices while for boat its 22 much tough job to switch devices. OVERALL Around 4000 INR headset ,no one can beat real me.",5
Excellent build quality but OK sound quality as its more on shriller side. Bass is fine for me as I am not a bass lover.Good deal for most users for the price but not for audiophiles like me.,4
I am using this product from last 3 months.Its good but not the best.In this price range I think it's better than JBL.its battery backup is impress me.Its lasted 8 hours .,4
"For Bluetooth earphone sound is good enough, it produce decent sound with nice bass i like the sound,design is superb,battery is also good, a good package in this price",5
i love flip cart super product always provide.and help full once my product was missing but flipcrat refund my money so thank u so much,5
"Delivery was real great, faster than expected.Sound quality is real great. Good vocals , good bass, good highs n mids , everything's more excellent, but not the best. Still, definitely best in this price range, infact it's better than boat ones. I'll rate 9 on 10 for sound quality. 9.5 for build quality , 9.75 for connectivity , 10 for battery . It's a no brainer at this price , just go for it blindly",5
"Headphones are really good!! Better than Noise Tune Flex as simply because Realme has better audio driver! Bass is also good.I bought Teal Green colour, which is very bright and impressive and goes with formal as well as casual  clothes. Build Quality is premium, Buds are really comfortable to wear. It's very light weight,As per my use, I use Netflix for atleast 1:30hr daily, apart from that music for atleast 2-3 hrs! It lasted for 4 days which is very good",5
"Awesome product. Sound quality is too good, design is awesome , got it in one day. Thank u flipkart. I will review after using some days.",5
"Build Quality is not that great, but sound quality is awesome and bass is average, which I liked personally. I would say it is best buy mainly considering best battery back and great sound quality.I didn't have any issues with mic too.",5
"i rarely give review so trust me everything is so good but bass is not so high, build quality is very good and lightweight , battery backup is up to mentioned standards, overall the product is exuberant and best wireless earphones under 2k.very much pleased with this thing",5
Awesome Product built by realme must Buy low weight sound quality is good enough for this prize and it's really failed to other compititor i am satisfied with the product and service. Thanks Realme and Flipkart,5
"Good Purchase and best in segment ( Compare to  MI, Samsung and Boat)ProsBassBattery BackupHassel free ConnectionConsNo dedicated control for Next/Prev.Non Adjustable CordPricing",5
"Those who are saying bass is less they actually listen to high bass headphones that lacks the overall sound quality. This earphone has a balanced audio signature.. highs and mids are crystal clear, they dont muffle on full volume. Lows are punchy rather than boomy. Go for the earphones if you used to listen all types of music. And those who want boom just use a Equalizer to give a boom to your music.",5
A very good sound quality and a very balanced sound.... I have one issue with its design.... It has not properly cable management.... Lgta hai ki jaise wo nikl jaega.. Agr force lga usp to... But all the way... It is superb... Money satisfaction in its first song..... Baki aaplog dekhlo jaisa aapka man... 😍😍😅😅,5
Realme did a good job. Thanks. Product is to good. Light weight. Easy to use. Love it.,5
What an awesome device it is.1. The sound is very good here with little boosted bass which you may like.2. Design is exactly the samw to oneplus bullet wirelessand the build quality is very good at this price point.3. The call quality is not bad.4. What is the most highlighting feature is the magnetic earbuds which are fully functional like that of OnePlus bullet wireless. That's pretty damn good at this price and worked flawlessly everytime.I am simply very happy and recommend highly to...,5
"It's an awesome product. Decent quality and good battery life, value for money,best earphone in its price range. I am happy with this product.",5
Amazing product from real me loved it is perfect while gaming also it's up to its mark loved it very much,5
Product which is so durable and great design. Music and calling thing is perfect for this. Value for money product as i buy product after so mch of review and i think for an such price its perfect to buy.,5
"Battery Backup : It gives a battery backup on average about 5 hours , I don't know how the reviewers say that it is giving a battery backup upto 10 hrs or 12 hrs. 5 hrs battery backup is pretty descent as it charges really fast.Sound Quality : I would say that sound quality is decent , I compared it with JBL C50HI which is a wired headset and I bought it for a really low price and believe me they both are providing the same sound quality.🧲 Power On/Off feature : This is the Game changing...",3
Everything is good & perfect except audio delay. If you are a pubg player pls don't buy there a lot of delay in audio while playing like example u get the bullet sound's only after ur dead  🤣 other than everything is good for this price  battery life is very good & its very comfortable with s bud,5
"The best part of this earphone is its battery back-up.The sound quality is also excellent but its bass is where i think should be somewhat better or else its a great earphone.Telling about connectivity, it is also quick and remains connected upto 10-12 metres of distance.The ON/OFF system of earphone is also unique i.e. when the ear buds are attached they will turn off and when seperated they will be on.Overall i loved this product.",5
The product is owsme and sound is good it will set ears are good and battery is superb and design is good *** it was a quality product from realme,4
Honest reviewAfter using for over two weeks I find it really worthy for buying.. build quality is awesome and battery backup is tremendous.. bass could have been more nice but can compromise with the overall performance.. 😊,4
Writing this review post using it for a month. Will divide it in pros and cons.Pros:Awesome battery lifeGood sound qualityGood connectivity even if driving over 100 kms/hr on bike (no distractions at all)Cons:Bass is not that greatCall answering and disconnecting physical button placement is very poorNo idicator for left and right earFor me it was looking like a deal breaker while reading the features but doesn't feel so post using it,3
The sound is good but do not expect much...the bass is lacking. But the materials used are good and looks attractive. Cant comment on durability but i expect it to last a good 3 years. Connectivity has been perfect and magnetic function is very useful,4
Really AMAZING !!! awesome building quality and sound is very good at this price. Battery is 20 days for me as i am normal listnerJust go blindly for this earphone.,5
"Don't expect too much as other reviewers have said about sound quality and particularly bass. Battery backup is pretty good. Sound is also good but it is not up to the mark. I was earlier using Sennheiser cx180 and I must say that when I compared the sounds and overall performance I literally felt that apart from Bluetooth connectivity and some handy functions, Sennheiser was a bit ahead in overall music experience. Well considering the Bluetooth functionality and good looks these buds defini...",4
It's looking good 👌.. sounds quality good &Battery better approx 9-10hr overall good neckband...,5
"Realme Earbud is a very nice product compared to other bluetooth headset like boAt rockerzz and Boult and samsung level U. Undoubtedly, a nice and handy product at this range. Perfectly value for money !!",5
Good enough in this price range.And the most helpful feature is the magnetic sensor which is very effective in practical use.,5
This is a good product. It also gives good sound clarity and good bass. The yellow coloured cable is not good. It would have been better if it were a full black colour.Thank you.,4
"If I want to say from the perspective of price💰 and specifications🔩 offered, it's THE BEST 👌 in that category.... Only thing I didn't like about this product is the colours which they are offering😭. I had to compromise finally with the Green colour🐸... No doubt these colours are very classy and stylish🐍🐤🎃...But along with those colours they should have offered some decent colours like Black🦍, White🦢, Metallic Finish colors🐘  etc.... 👀",5
"I am in love with my (Green) realme buds wireless bluetooth headset.They look super cute and sexy good build quality, excellent sound and bass. The audio quality is superrr the auto connect and disconnect is gem and saves a lot of battery.",5
Excellent awesome I like it very good product,5
"it's an amazing feeling to your ears.It looks stylish , performs awesome and sounds superb",4
I love the product but with one and which i think its nly with me the main earphone it not firmly locked in the ear like other i have used havit g1 m not comparing both are best in their price range then too otherwise not at all stand in front of this one the sound bass everything is well balanced great work from realme,4
"All is well and good but the when we receive a call All of its quality is gone to hell!! 1) Best for listening songs ,  2) Good for video , 3) Bad for calling",4
"Great looks and good feel. Sound is not awesome but good enough, and bass is just good. Yes, battery back up is excellent. Ear buds would be more easy and comfortable for longer use in ears.Realme is done a great work in decent price.",4
"Sound quality is best in this price range, the bass is very good. These earplugs handle those lows and highs very perfectly even the mids are good.Cable quality is also good and you'll surely fall for the battery life.And most importantly these are a perfect fit and you cn use them for hours without even feeling a little uneasiness",5
Amazing product at this price range.The battery back up is incredible and it barely takes time to fully recharge itself.Sound quality is good. Mid tones are clearly audible. A great buy in this range. I would definitely recommend.,5
Awesome sound quality in this price. I like it very much. Thank you flipkart. Highly recommend,5
"perfect sound, nice interface and good BT range with ample battery",4
"Here is my review after 15days of usage.Pros:1. Sound quality is pretty good. Loud enough2. Bass is nice , but I felt realme buds 2 have better bass and sound quality.  (May be it's because of Bluetooth headset, I've used many Bluetooth headsets, all are the same. Doesn't have the quality of wired headsets)3. Build quality is pretty nice.4. Auto play and pause option while playing music, while attaching and detaching magnets 5. Noise cancelation is very nice. Cons:1. I felt the like ...",4
"It's an over all decent package for the price. bass is a bit flat and not at all dynamic but i have tried other sub 2k bt earphones and it does have a better loudness and bass than those. battery back up is pretty good too. but it's ugly AF. not sure who decided that it was a good idea to not have all black earphones option.they look tacky, esp if you are a professional or not a teenager. yellow stands out on your clothing.even design wise they are not great. charging slot is not protect...",4
seamless connection magnetic auto on/off is very amazing & new experience for me I'm happy to purchase this amazing headset,5
"nice ear buds .... light weight if company add memory comply ear tips  then it's very comfortable to use ..... magnetic on off switch really good .. bass not punch as compared to higher ..brand , this price it's best",5
super nice product sound is super over sound bass not clear,5
awesome product with good built quality and design with awesome color battery backup is to good but sounds quality need to increase,5
1) the best sound quality %992) excellent design%88 3) good quality%854) good battery backup%955) super extra bass%100Total 4.6 rating,5
1) Built quality & battery backup excellent  2) sound quality nice & 80% sound level is almost too much for normal person this is bcz of 11.2 mm driver. Above this level u get little bit lower sound clarity bt overall sound good 🤞3)when u connect to laptop magnetic control stop music in earphone bt music remain carry out speakers of laptop,4
Fabulous i like this earphone everything is very good sound quality bass design all is very good,5
Received my product today. Design and quality is the best. Best neckband in reasonable price. Comfortable and easily operable. Must buy it. Very satisfied with my product. Thanks flipkart.,5
It's very good. But I thind sound is somewhat low. Like sometimes watching YouTube videos in some videos the real feel doesn't comes like headphones. But overall it's great product. Definitely worth buying.,4
"better than other headphones which are available in same price range, sound and build quality is great, bass should be more but it's negligible for me, for me it's a complete wireless headphone with great battery backup, need to charge only twice a week.go for it it's a complete headphone in 2000 price range",5
super bass. super sound. super mic.all is super but charge ing point type usb charger pin. please realme provide type C port ear buds,5
"everything is good with these bluetooth earphones must buy in these range! 1 thing to take care of is your size of the ear , me personally had problems with sticking them up in my right ear but with the change in plastic covering it fits perfectly! plus the magnets work perfectly as on and off no problems in that! i great deal i must say!👍",5
vocals are too good in this price..bass is avarage..i love bass boosted sounds in my ear..but the bass is balanced on this one..but one thing that I don't like but it's the common problem with this range of wireless headphones is there is a delay in sound in pubg mobile like games..but there is no delay in the audio of any kind of  video.. battery is the key of choice here..,4
Very nice product nice battery backup to good and build design nice,5
didn't quite meet my expectations which i had after reading reviews......The sound quality is not bad but just average considering the price range. Also the bass is not upto the mark. The battery no doubt is best part of these earphones. Aslo the isolation of these is good.The sound compared to boat rockerzz 255 is not at all satisfying. Boat rockerzz had such an amazing sound that if u are planning to switch from boat to realme.....Please don't.. U'll cry. So the final verdict is if u r W...,3
"Iam writing this review after 2 weeks of analysis... First of all am a dj music producer (remix).. In my opinion it's a good product below 2, 000 rs... It has super sound quality with extra thumb bass.... If you are a music producer (remixer,  dj ) then buy it.. because it is crystal clear sounds and we can hear the very small sounds that is good for a music artist... the build quality is nice and battery backup is also good.. Am writing this long review because i loved this product.... the o...",5
Excellent product. I love this. Excellent sound clarity and Bass.,5
The built quality is super and functions is perfect but the bass is very low if your are try to  buy think use from  someone used because the bass is very low and in movies time dont get the sound effects perfectly,4
Nice product but price is little bit high but i m purchase in 1520 in republic day sale and headphone quality its to good and sound bass is superb in this price . Comfort ear loops on/off system is different from others brandsExtra 2 pairs Ear budsCharge cable is too sort 3-4inch Allover i am happy with this device,5
"I ordered this for my friend and he loved it. The sound quality is awesome. Good job Realme, would appreciate for your efforts.",4
"Excellent product by realme, using headset for a week, sound and bass quality are very much impressive, far better than boat. Battery backup is also too good. I am in love with realme buds wireless.",5
"i love its battery back up , its awesome , sound is very nice , bass sometimes lacks , otherwise very nice product",5
"Delivery Was Dam Worst , It took 15 days & not  delivered on Given  Date  .  But Buds are good , sound is good but do not compatible with wired earphones . But good in Wireless Category",4
these are pretty good actually have high bass plus its connectivity is good too. battery backup is just perfect long lasting and the mic did pretty good...although if u are searching for gaming these are not for u because it have sound delay of 1 seconds in game but for music its great,5
i bought this after reading all the positive reviews of this product. but i am disappointed with the sound quality. i guess the reviews have been manipulated. it's not worth 1799. boat headphones are cheaper with better soundUPDATE: THIS WORKED FOR 5 MONTHS AND 20 DAYS...10 DAYS LESS THAN WARRANTY PERIOD. PLEASE BUY HEADPHONES HAVING ATLEAST ONE YEAR WARRANTY,3
This is an Awesome Blutooth Headset. Very Light and Reliable !!You must buy this one if you want a Premium quality in Cheaper Price !!,5
"biuld quality is awesome,  mic is also good,  earphones looks premium, comfort to wear with flexible band, decent sound quality & good battery. but it lacks certain features like         1. showing battery % in mobile 2. telling mobile number while incomeing call 3. max volume indication . but the major disappoointment is # gap between video & audio sync. #",5
"good product , i am use it , so much stylist and looking nice , sound quality is good , over all very good , i recommend all of you",5
really appreciate Best Performance super cool and smart toy's,5
I like this very beautiful sound reang anything good I'm full happy thanks,5
"I would rather segregate the review into two different parts. 1. Pros - Built quality is amazing, material used for both, the band & the wire is too good. The keys are also well desgined, you feel it as soft keys. Also the sound quality is amazing. Bass is just thumping. You won't get better sound than this at least in this budget. 2. Cons - Biggest blow i feel is the noise cancellation followed by battery back up. There is no noise cancellation, there is no physical mic too. In  fact when yo...",4
The product is good but if you are fan of bass then you will be dissatisfied. Build quality is good and feels good to use. Battery has been good so far. Overall a good purchase till now,5
Sound is good for the price range they are offering but bass is very average & at higher volume sound clarity gets very average & irritating.Overall Performance is Good,4
This is overall a good product.. Review Battery is average ... you can use it for 6-7 hours max sound quality is good Connectivity is also good ..,5
Sounds are pretty nice but one issue with the wire of earphones that it is little big from thr neck to ear  and there is also no any option to adjust that wire so it hurts me little.. by the way you can get with boult curve wireless becouse sound qualify is just same as this realme only realme has enough price than boult cure you can get in 1399 only,5
"Very nice products with beautiful design and good battery backup,, support on every phone",5
This realme buds are of very good quality and it looks very premium. Its sound and built quality is also very good but one thing I am not satisfied with is that the bass is not that  much as it was written in specification. Otherwise everything is ok.,4
very nice product.sound quality superb i am amazed with this product love you Flipkart.,5
"very good product just go for it , battery backup is very nice and vocals are also clear and perfect",4
i am very happy to buy such a wonderful product by realme awesome sound quality with thumping base. i have used so may wireless earphones of different brands but really guys these are one of the best at its price range...you can blindly go for it..,5
I don't know about other but I googled n read lots of review then bought this headset I love it's sound quality battery life is amazing I just charge of 1hrs something n it last whole day. I really recommend it to buy,5
"first of all i thanks to flipkart fr good delivery service. at last i finally gt an product which is good in quality. strong build, premium finishing quality bt bass was nt as my expectations. the bass little bit down. bt the best thing its doesn't hurt in ears in full volume its very balancing sound. its very light weight and comfortable...",5
"1000 times better than boat rockerz 225f . Bass and music volume is really good as compared to others. design, features and battery backup is also very good. Best part is magnetic on off functionality. really happy with my purchase.",5
sometimes we think that bass wasn't great but in fact it provide great sound quality and also with good higs as well as lows and the good bass also I m using it with oneplus 7 and i never disappointed with sound quality only one thing was annoying i.e. the colour combinations of black yellow and it's not provide good looks,4
"bass is there.. but on the lighter side.. I preferred the audio quality over the over powering bass but the only thing that threw me off is the latency ,, while watching videos .. there is neglechable difference.. but while playing pubg and codm ..there is a noticable difference.. over all this a nice BT headphones .. realme is doing good on the sound department.. but could've done better in latency",4
Flipkart delivery and packaging is awesome. Overall good product at this price segment. 'R' logo is not on the earpiece as shown on the display images. Works perfectly with laptop and mobile.,5
nice product  with good sound quality .........i continously used for 3 hours battery back up is great when it compare to mi neck bands,4
Awesome product.... Clear audio... Worth product to purchase... 10 star for real me.. For me its way better than jbl headset,5
its very good product to everyone who wants to have a good bluetooth with all specifications and magnet sensor battery level was sooo good and soo comfort to wear and and earbuds are very comfort to wear soo happy 😊,5
looks and build are good. on sound output - bass is good but lacks clarity. expected more from 11.1 driver. I suggest for RS.400 less boat rockers 255 best in this budget less than 2k. I have tested my friend's boat the audio clarity and bass is awesome.,3
Very good sound quality bass decent battery backup is good fill  like premium quality product over all good product value for money I love it,4
"Awesome product, compare to motorola and sony at this price segment, this is faar best then them. Go for it. one of the best future of this product is, when you saparate the ear buds they will automatically connect to the phone, and when you joint two ear buds product automatically disconnected from phone.,",5
It's a really good neck band I have ever experienced and it's good recommendation for it good,5
for me this is one of the best bluetooth headset audio quality greatbuild quality great battery backup great worth every penny,5

Nice one this wireless bluetooth buds and maganatic functionality is more convenient and fast pairing also pretty smooth.,4
it's very nice for battery backup sound quality good all are very good but suggestion for realme plz make it  comfortable for pubg game .....sound getting late after action two seconds,5
song qualities nice if you listen 80% to 85% after 90% its sound quality is bad but I think you never use 70% it's very loud... base is nice more than nice... battery backup is very good and also battery backup very good because is magnetic on off... and connectivity Bluetooth very good it's connecting in 5 second in last device connected microphone is good but not very good,5
The earphones are very nice. Sound quality is good only when both buds are plugged in ear. Noise cancellation is excellant. I am using this earphone in Gym where external music is very loud. But it cancels 90% of the sound. You will not hear what other people are saying. Do not use it while walking roadside or while driving. But sometimes it shows voice lag while playing PUBG. The build quality is sturdy. OVERALL it's a really nice pair of earphones. I would definetly recommend it to all. I a...,5
good bye I am happy sound quality is excellent highly recommend,5
excellent product form realme and product quality is good and sound quality is good and best product this price range. Flipkart is fast delivery  thanks Flipkart and happy New year 2020 😍😍🎧🎧🎧,5
Awesome 🔋 Backup Sound quality is so nice and clear .Bass is Awesome .Build quality should be more comfortable otherwise it's fine .overall a worthily purchase.,5
not for those who are looking for bass heavy earphone..  and not for gaming sound delay of almost 1sec.. light weight best fitted.. choose right size earbuds nice one..crystal clarity 8.5/10 bass 7/10 midtone 9/10 overall sounds quality 8.5/10..,4
"good for calling, voice was clear and good for music listening also. battery backup is awesome . not recommended for pubg game as there is delay in sound.",4
Extremely satisfied with this product. Magnet acting like swich is a great feature. Bass is really at optimal level. Sound quality is really superb. Though realme is new to market i just went with review comments.,5
"Didn't expect such good sound clarity from wireless headsets under 2k.Sound- 5Bass- 4 (Good bass, but won't be good enough for bassheads)Durability- 5Connectivity - 5",5
there was very excellent choice who can find a best and quality nackband any person a best bluetooth headset so who can buy this there was lots of sound quality +bass and product quality .,4

"v.v.v. good product, I love it. Keep on Realme. you will be the best. thank you.",5
I have given 5 stars for battery backup based of previous reviews .. but all other 5 stars are genuine based on my experience . really satisfied realme and thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery . The green colour is best according to me but you may prefer yellow black one,5
1. The best part of this is that magnetic connection with on and off of the headset.2. if you are really really really a bass listener then go for above                2000 Rs/- bt colour headset..3. Battery capacity is 👌🤩4. built quility is very very good..5. UNDER 2000 IT IS THE BEST ONE BCZ.... MI HEADSET IS NOT THAT GOOD AND BOAT IS NOT AT BASS.,5
its built qualit is excellent buds are of superb quality sound experience is osm and full of thrillmade used for making is excellent its realy give premium feel when they are around neckvery light weight battery backup is osm...,3
excellent headphones with nice sound quality & has great features like magnetic lock where music is paused when the earphone's are attached together,5
Great headset by Realme. Good material and great sound.Playback for 2 hours within 15 mins of charging and almost 100% within an hour and half.,5
sound is good bass good so nice flexible band some other band,5
"overall good built quality, battery backup, design, super ,but sound quality is not just like advertising for realme not good on this price point,sound quality more better in Boat rockardz 255.",3
Its nice.. pretty basic.. not that base but good enough.. would have loved if it had USB C for charging..,5
One of the best blue tooth headset from real me just loved it and must buy. The bass is awesome and battery backup also good totally worth for every paisa.,5
"The Realme Buds are good Bluetooth earphones for the price. Design and Build quality is good, though the color options on offer can be better. Sound quality is decent with adequate bass. The highlight of these earphones is the phenomenal battery backup of about 10hrs(at 60-80% volume). Although it comes with Bluetooth 5.0 it doesn't support aptX and uses the lower quality AAC codec. The neckband is comfortable even after prolonged use. Overall a good product.",4

Also there's no option for turning it off, either it can be off by connecting 2 buds or have disconnect every device for 5 minutes. Physical we can not turn off...",1
very nice,5
Such a waste product I did see never 🙅 it was good for listening songs but not useful for PUBG players and voice calling mic also not working properly,1
"Purchased this on Feb 2020 and today on April 7th, the mic has stopped working. Now all I can do this with this headset is listen to music or movies. This is the quality for you. Within 2 months it has lost one functionality and with national lockdown I cant even get this repaired.",1

Well i wasn't expecting it to be so good. Its loud has the punchy bass. If used only for calling would last for 2 to 3 days. If music played at high volume would last around 7 to 9 hours. Good product. Lets see how many days i will be able to use it. Build quality seems to be good. No issues so far.,5

Faulty only left side working right side faulty,1
Your product is too bad as well as your company. Your company is cheater. Guy please don't buy any product from Flipkart. This is totally fraud company.whatever they send us the product is totally changed and cheaper product.,1
"After this 5 months of use, the mic is not working now.  The rubber material around the neck part started to tear apart. Mic is not working now while in any sort of call. Normal call or whatsapp call mic is not working. But recording audio its working. Can any one suggest a way to resolve it?",1

"bestest product I ever experienced love this one😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘, everyone should buy this product 😍😍❤️❤️😘😘😘❤️❤️😍😘",5
Product is good. But the only issue I can see is that sound and call receiving buttons are on the same button ( 3 different locations ). So when a call comes it is very difficult to feel which button you are pressing. Because of this it is very difficult to receive calls while you are walking. If they would have made 3 different buttons that would have been better. Mostly I have to receive calls through phone only.,4
Stopped working after 1yr.. Warrenty khatam product khatam😝,1
Bad   used product Damaged. See pics,1
"Worst product. I bought it in January and it stopping working with my laptop a month back and also with my iPhone.When I checked with service center, they say this wirelss earphone is meant only for Android mobile phones and it will not work with laptop or iPhones.Now, I am stuck with an useless product.",1
Very bad Bluetooth..I bought it 3 times and every time same problem I suffer..left ear piece didn't work longer.. I really hated it,1
I have purchased bund after 10 days in battery backup is poor quality 100% battery die in 1 hours,2
"No vibration is there and the mic takes outside noise more due to that other listen less voice during market train etc, rest of all is awesome",4
Don't buy from them...they gives you replica product...it's design like original..bt sounds quality is very poor...I am not a 1st time user so don't try to cheat with me flipkart ....Nd finally Going to return it,1

Please check the seller before buying thr D-tron seller were very cheating and cheap quality item was sent so please check the seller before buying there is no return on this item,1
Nice product. Built quality good. Sometimes battery quickly goes down and sometimes it automatically turn off without joining the buds. Overall its a good product.,4

"Auto magnetic on off system is not working,  automatically disconnected after every 30 min. It's looking like already used... And now it's showing not return product.... Very bad experience with tis product and also with u Flipkart..... You are not trustworthy",1
Different model that of order model. I hate this.,1
Buds background is so large (magnet part)I don't like product but not replace and return,5
Overall its a nice product but it automatically disconnected in usual intervals and when i see the option for return it was not there they told to contact company directly so that was the worst thing i go through even in 30 days,2
Some magnetic issue... Automatic magnetic off on   immediately  not working  ... After turn off your Bluetooth it  takes 5 minutes for off .. and pawer off on button is also available,2
Super,4

connecting issues. mobile shows hanging problems after connecting to realme buds. music video didn't play many times. sometimes even received call didn't provide sound in buds. worst product. please do not buy this. sound quality n all other things are later but first it must provide it's basic functionality. what is use of buds if you can not call on call properly or you can not play video or listen music without any problem. 👺,1

Sound distribution is not good and left side ear bud are too loud than right side which leads to severe headache 😡 worst product by realme,1
Worst product ever....I bought this product and after just 2days of use....one side has failed to work,1
Honest review Best for Music. Bass Quality is perfect. Build quality is very great. Feeling in the ears very smooth. Battery backup 7-8 hours. Not for gamers time delay\letacy in games. Rest if you are buying it for music and calling purpose go for it.,5
Product is not up to the mark but comparing to other wireless earphones of same range than it is better than those. Build quality is not really good. Charging port is of very very cheap material. Which is main issue. If u want to purchase a wireless earphones for the maximum use of 6-8 months. Than go with this one.,2
The worst ever service by flipkart.You can return this product.This is not supported in Bluetooth version 4.1.The worst buying experience for ever.,1

I am facing charging problem,1
After reading the reviews I was having very high expectations about the audio quality and bass but was bit disappointed as it was pretty average my boat wired headset gives better acoustics and bass than this...paring and connection is very fast..pause/stop and disconnect by magnetically attaching ear buds is very convenient...battery life and standby is good..value for money,4

Excellent battery backup.. one charge comes easily for 4 days... Only problem is that yellow colour of wire.  It will be an excellent product if it completely black,5
"Product is great, connects easily within 4-5 seconds. Bass is awesome and clear. Battery lasts for 4-6hours when Connected. Eg, will consume more battery if used while Binging TV shows/movie and playing games like COD and PUBG. While on call the battery lasts longer. If you've regular user/heavy user need to charge in every 2 days.",5
Best neckband in this price.. Really loved it. ❤❤❤,5
Super Sound quality nice Battery life also good Good design,4

Sound nd build quality is good in ear fit is also good but the only problem with this is mic it works great but while you are riding a bike cant use it to take calls person on the other side will hear only noise not your words,4
One side not working.. waste product,1
"Sometimes Bluetooth got automatically disconnected,overall good product ,light weight, comfortable but not inside helmets",3
Excellent sound quality and the bass is uo to mark.Decent battery life. Nearly two days on normal usage,5
Really Good,4
built quality is the best u can getsound quality is literally sooo goodbattery goes for minimum 10hrs complete heavy usage or for 20 hrs light usage.. with the battery charging so fastoverall 11outof10 just go for iteven if ur budget is 1.5k.. extend it a lil bit n get this one,5

Really amazing I loved it posting aft one month of usage really worth of buying the when he buying Brand times u will never cheated,5
Not bad...waste money..price 1000 honiiithii,3
Good sounds &battery backup,4
"First thing i should say abt this earphone : Insane Battery backup.Sound is good, Bass is mediocre (nothing special). Mids are nice, highs and lows are good but could be better.Considering the price point, its a notch ahead of the offerings.Satisfied.",3
"dont hezitate , just buy nd enjoy 🤗👌",5
"Best Earphones for Gym and Sports, got it for 1599 !!!",5
It's awesome,5
Wow,3
What I felt after using it was there should have been a cover over the charging lid so as to minimize the risk of any sort of damage inside. Overall sound quality just more than expectation heavy and punchy booming base. I'm contended!,5
"Build quality is good - the wires are thicker than regular and button areas are of aluminium construction. Bass and the clarity of sound is remarkable. Only downside is the medium capacity battery, which holds  backup for 2 days of heavy usage, and absence of ip67 certification. You will have to save it from sweat. But cant really complain after getting it at a lower price compared to others. Overall a cool product. I will definitely recommend!",5

It's too awsome,5
Realme Buds are not ment HIGH BASE lovers.For High base and sturdy build prefer Boat Rockers But battery backup is awesome.Compared this product as I own both of them.,3
These buds have mic which lies around neck .so either you will have to speak loud or move mic closer to your mouth. Should have been better if mic had been near. Rest music wise Good to go.,3

Pros:Sound clarity is goodOn/off is controlled by magnets. Disconnecting magnets will switch on the device and vice versa.Build quality is goodBattery backup is goodCons:Bass is not up to the mark. Volume levels are lowYellow color is odd. Couldn't find other colors.Price should be around 1500Difficult to press the buttons.,4
sound quality was not good only base was there trubbles and vocals are not clear .....i want to replace it with some other wireless earphone but flipcart not sccept return.....i feel so unsatisfied..,1
"Very bad experience during calls..Even after it gets connected ..and volume is max .... nothing is audible during calls , video calls,group meetings...etc.Sometimes strange robotic buzzing sound comes..Will have to connect and disconnect 3-4 times to finally get proper connection..Left side has stopped working after 8-9 months",1
"Comparing with Boat Rockerz, Realme Buds headset has more treble than bass, which affects its overall sound quality.The color combination is very bad.Rubber pads are not useful, they supposed to hang in the ear.The Bluetooth range is poor.Costlier than the other same range of products.Power ON/Off Tech is impressive, saves battery life.",1

LONG BUT WORTH READING.Honest review after one week. Just go for it. Dont get affected by negative reviews. Totally worth every penny and far ahead of its competition. The battery backup is splendid.

I am a student and watch video lectures at sometimes 2x speed and never once I faced voice lag while changing video speed. Just go for it. Ju...,5

I have used this with a non OnePlus device so take that into consideration when reading this. Just want to mention that if you are not an audiophile you will never notice the difference between AAC and aptx. These earphones only support AAC and SBC.Cons:The bass is very much lacking. The treble at higher volumes sometimes (although rarely) starts tearing up. If you are interested in movies with a lot of explosions and bullets flying around it won't be a very immersive experience. Pros:S...,3
"I'm fan for Oneplus since their first product. I have bought the series of products along their launch. Very first product from oneplus which did not meet my expectations is 'oneplus bullets wireless-z bluetooth headset'. It has no BASS effect at all!!! if you are buying for listening music and music lover, better to avoid. However, call quality, voice clarity  and battery backup are at its best. One of the best headset to consider for day to day usage.",1

But it's not a basshead earphones, I've seen some reviews saying it's got such an amount of base but in reality it's a balanced headphones adequate amount of bass nothing much more.This one plus sounds good when it comes to overall sound quality, it's all balanced Product quality is superb at this price range you can't complainMagnetic on/off is very helpful in saving battery life and convenient too, you don't have to switch it off and on, just detach it and it in...",5

"I have been using this product from couple months. This headset will absolutely not work for calls. The reason is, the build of Wireless Z will not get mic near our mouth. However, it works if you have absolute patience to hold the mic in front of your mouth for hours you talk or be in meetings. This headset is only nice for listening songs compromising on Bass !

"This product is fabulous in this price range ..... In 2k I have 18hours playback. Earlier I thought that this product should give atleast 12 hours backup, but on other hand terrific battery life. If you are searching for wireless earphone then go for it. Just not because I'm saying, it just worth it.",5
1)Sound Quality Is Best.2)Bass superb but less than OnePlus bullet 2.3) Design and Build quality is best.4) Battery Back-up is very very Awesome. Standby time is 8-9 hour in 10 min charging..5) Full charge backup 19-20 hours really good and Best..6) Latency is Awesome i am tested this in Call of Duty..7) Noise cancellation is in Average mode ..8) Full charge in 25-30 min..In 10 min 50-60 % charge.9) connectivity is Awesome working in OnePlus...Other devices take time 5-10 se...,5
"Really good wireless headset. I came across a lot of reviews saying the bass is not so good. But I didn't feel so . It's really good.The sound quality is so balanced and it's perfect for movies , music and calls.",5
"Primary purpose of selecting this headset:Since I have many calls/meetings throughout the day, I needed a headset with good battery backup (was fed up of my ANT headset as it used to run out of battery midway through the day), something which is comfortable and flexible enough to use in a rough manner.Why I believe this is just perfect for my needs-*Battery easily lasts 2 full days of moderate to heavy use (close to 14-15hrs playback)*Charging from 0-100% is done in 40mins (i use Sam...",4
Its almost a month nowVery good purchase. Fast charging supported. Charged in less than 30 minutes with my realme 30w charger.Good battery backup lasting about 2 to 3 days.Not so good for bass lover. Has some bass but not that thumping sound.Sound quality is excellent with good mic quality.It has type c so don't have to carry another wire.Well done one plus.,5
I THINK THIS HEADSET IS BEST IN THIS RANGE. BETTER SOUND QUANTITY AS COMPARE TO OTHER HEADSET AND DESIGN ALSO IS LOOKS LIKE A CLASS.,5
"Awesome battery backup for 15 hour continuouslyBuild quality is greatAnd call quality is superIn can be used continuously for whole dayAnd sound quality is better then other competitors in market.Worth to spend a little more money on this then Realme and Xiaomi.And the best bart is i mainly use it for PUBG.But i have Oneplus 7 Pro so that could be the reason also, that i didn't face any sound delay.If you don't have Oneplus device you could face sound delay in gaming.GO FOR IT......!",5
Battery backup is really great as promised by company. But sound quality is like basic Nokia  earphones we were getting many years back. Now that's what we expect from branded ones.  Less sound  very little bass  not satisfied,3
Probably the best bluetooth earphones by OnePlus in this price range.Masterpiece in itself.Build quality top notch.Sound quality is awesome.Bass is adequate and sweet.Treble is perfectly balanced.What else do you need?,5
Bass is average 6/10Build quality is good 9/10Battery  back up is awesome 😀 10/10Sound is ok 8/10For calling is fine 8/10Connectivity is good 10/10Water resistance is good 9/10Charging time is excellent 10/10Latency is there and is low with OnePlus 7tOverall rating is 8/10,4
"This oneplus bullets wirless Z is excellent deal..battery backup is awesome as told by the company earlier...it takes approximately 1 hour to charge 100% by  C type dash charger ( I have one Plus 6 )... roughly it backup is almost 3 days( it also depends on the use).the looks is premium, u will not feel that in ur neck there is something, it is very light.the bass is good enough not huge not less..it is very balanced I must say the least. Overall its must  buy",5
If you are Bass lover this earphone is not for you but for a quality music and for smooth audio this one is best in the range.,5
Sound is very good .. but not that great ... For the  price point it's a very good product... U can go for it,4
The earphone ticks all the boxes. But what really sets it apart is its surprisingly clear clarity specially the vocals which are top notch. All the sounds are very discernible which makes it all the more pleasant.,5
"Honest review: OnePlus has a image of giving the best product which is pocket friendly as well. This wireless costs for 2k and the sound quality is way much better than the JBL E25bt earphones, trust me the bass vocal are top notch according to the pricing of the earphones. In 2k you will have features like waterproof, low latency mode (only for OP users), magnetic control (which I am loving it) easy pairing and quick switch (also loving the most) and the main feature of working for 10hours o...",5
"Amazing headset at such an awesome price. Internationally its priced $49 dollars which converts to Rs 3,689/- approximately according to the currency exchange rates today. Sound Quality is Awesome.Bass is a bit lacking.Battery Backup is awesome. (Also it charges completely within 1 hour with a 5W charger!)Features are top notch.",4
Pros>>>😍 the built quality really really good like it can be easily bended twisted and ut retains its shape back. And the magnetic controls loved this😍 supper comfy like i wore it for like 13 14 hrs still the was no pain and irritation and the weight is soo low that you cannot even feel it 😍safty like it doesnot falls from your ears even after a long workout session and it is light doent means that it can fall easily😍SOUND QUALITY for mids vocals lows and hidh it is realllly good l...,5
Vocals r too crisp... Actually bass earphones destroy the vocal quality of songs... So these oneplus earphones do full justice to the songs and other audio Plus I am a part-time Biology tutor and currently I am teaching my students online. The mic provide is a pretty good one.... It perfectly cut down maximum ambient noises and delivers a crisp call quality...Google meet and these earphones are a majestic combo for teaching onlineI am highly impressed,5
There  I bought it for 1999 these were value for money and Even I wish the design and build quality was so good and I would like thank Flipkart delivery. Boys they r serving people in this pandamic situation so good to be a Flipkart plus coustmer,4
I am writing this comment after one week of use Battery Back up is Nice Design is prity good Bluetooth connect too Good. Over all best product.,5
"It's a amazing product by One plus,I am falling love with it,, It's bass is good and battery backup is awesome,,, Everything is Good,, Mic quality is better than any earphone at this price It's a fabulous product,,,",5
"Exceeded my expectationsGot delivered it in 2 days. It came fully charged, been using it continuosly connected to my phone and laptop for conference calls.The battery is still showing 50% without charging it again even though i had long calls on laptop as well as on phone. The Quick switch funtion is a boon with its Quick pair feature. The neck band is damn comfortable and the earplugs didnt hurt my ears during long calls.The sound quality is above average with good vocals and instrument s...",5
"Ultimate beast in this range. The battery back up is killer in all classes. Easily runs more than 15 hours in a full charge. Speed charging takes only about 25 minutes from 0% to 100%. Sound quality is smooth, soft and clear. Bass is a bit low but using the correct ear bud can partially offset the  problem.  Connection quality is good. Connects fast (3 secs with Redmi note 7 pro. Switching between devices takes no more than 8 secs. Build quality is elegant and feels veery expensive. Also the ...",5
"Insane Battery backupThis thing is worth buying if you are bothered by frequent charging of your bluetooth earphone. This earphone has an insane battery backup and it full charges in approximately 20 minutes by my poco f1 charger. I got approximately 2 days of battery in single full charge with volume kept at 50 to 60%The sound quality is pretty kuch im0ressive even though it lacks a punch of bass, Im not a big fan of that bass hence that doesn't even bother me.The phone calls clarity i...",5
Thank u OnePlus for making such a good earphone.The best part is is connect in no time when you receive a call or listen music.,5

Fully satisfied with the product ..All the sound are just evenly distributed but if you listen only to bass songs then you wont be able to enjoy it. But i personally loved the product. You may get a delayed sound quality while playing a game ..in all other things ..they are best. My mother told that the packaging was better then her necklace box. 😂,5
Everything working fine awesome music quality which I never expected. Didn't notice any latency. Truely amazing.  Easy to connect  just separate the magnet it automatically connects.  Put them together it goes off.  Super features. Go for it,4
"It’s a good looking smart device with new aids like a button to easy switch between devices. Magnetic On off control and easily pairs with new players. With a premium Build it has a descent sound quality. It is a ideal earphone For everyday use like in gym, your, or sports as have a advantage of being light weight and flexible. Earbuds design is unique and provides a overall fit with a new look at the interior ears. Cons: earbuds silicon could be more soften for prolong use.",3
"I have tested a lot of earphones both premium (bose, beats etc) and earphones in this range. What one plus is offering in this range is way better than anyother earphones of similar category. I have read reviews where people are complaining about bass. I don't think that's something you need to worry about. Other wireless earphones in this range have negligible bass but one plus is still offering a decent bass, obviously not the bass you find in premium headsets. The audio quality is good wit...",5
"Battery backup is awesome 👌And it connects to my one plus 7 almost instantly.Very comfortable earplugs .Only single drawback is BASS.. Personally I won't recommend this for music lovers,however it's simply best for taking voice calls .It is simply worth every penny spent ..Go for it",4
Classy design ....easy connectivity....great music experience (u can customize the settings if u want according to Ur taste)...and the main reason I bought it was great battery (Coz usually the main issue with a budget Bluetooth device is the battery).All I can tell u is  it is the best one in the budget. Also u get the OnePlus branding . And yeah super fast delivery by flipcart .,5
"Pros: Sound quality is great but not too loud. Battery backup lasts more than 15h in optimal sound. Switch between the devices in exactly 3s once paired. Magnetic functionality for pause/disconnect.Bass too is decent enough (though I heard reviews saying bass is low) Cons:Charges in 45m without warp charger(compared to other brands, it charges quickly) Those who are bass lovers, can give it a try. Will not regret after you buy.",4
"Edit- They claim 20 mins for full charge. But it's a hoax. I have realme 30 Watt charger. it took 45 mins approx.Reducing 1 star for this.Whoever saying here that there is no bass is absolutely wrong.It has bass and that is also punchy.Not overpowering like realme that you can't hear vocals clearly.And most of the people who are buying are not musicians or sound expert, so let's not talk about high low mids trebble...all is Giberish.It has decent sound. Light weight. Long battery. Loo...",4
In short: I love this headset!I used two brands but both got damaged within a few months. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bluetooth Headset is an amazing product. Ten minutes charging last at least two complete days in normal usage. The sound is good and no change after one month. Durability is another feature - the sweat and water drops never affect the product quality. Even the wires are also high durable.I recommend everyone to use this product to enjoy a premium quality headset with an a...,5
My honest review after using it for 1 monthPros: 1)If you prefer excellent battery backup then you can blindly go for it.2) Very clear and good voice quality3) connection to the device is very  fast.4) I really liked magnetic stop and play feature it is very quick and useful.Cons:1) If you are a bass lover then it's definitely not for you.2) Call quality is good but noise cancellation is not that great especially if it's windy.,4
"I suggest one plus users to simply go for it as it is worth for money. Its also a very good option for other devices so blindly go for it. Excellent battery backup ,build and sound quality.",5
Good sound quality and battery backup is superb. I think this is the best headphones under 2k. Please note that it is more suitable for one plus smart phone users because compatibility is better in one plus.dolby Atmos sound superb with this headphone.

Great work done by oneplus on the battery side, well people who like bass can't prefer this but over all the built quality and sound quality is good . Thank you OnePlus for this amazing product.",5
The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z is best wireless headphones for this price. But it has its Pros and Cons.Pros-1.The Sound quality is very good and supports AAC Audio Codec.2. The battery lasts very long and with average usage can last upto 3 days(6 hrs a day use).3. Once connected the headphones connected instantly everytime.4.  Quick Switch is a very usefull feature..Cons-1. The bass is low and does not give the thumping feeling.2. There is a small lag while playing pubg.3. It does ...,5

It's simply awesome in this price range ... Nice sound ... Decent bass & treble ... Highly recommend .. value for money ... Lag felt in pubg.. but my one phone is Honor 10 & another is iphone se both having only Bluetooth 4.2 version .. sometimes because of that .. stylish one ..,5
Awesome one... Connecting with OnePlus phone like apple Airpod as soon as you remove the earbuds from eachother it will auto connect. Best wireless earphone in budget price.,5

"Guys this headset is the best buy currently under 2k. But, let me say this the sound quality of the realme buds is just better. I got to admit that. Not still I recommend this one because of the features like a da*n good battery and type C port. And also the buttons are better placed and tactile. So I would say either wait for the realme buds Pro or if you are in a hurry but this one.Nb: If sound quality is your main concern, go for realme but compromising on type c and 2-3 hours of battery.",5
"Best product at this price point. Just go for it beacuse :1. Perfect fit no issues.2. Dont fall for neagtive reviews3. Sound quality is amazing with average base quality but you dont even realize.4. For pubg lovers amazing real time audio , no lag.5. Battery is superb.Go for it, if you are looking for oneplus earbuds.Note : If you have oneplus phone then only buy otherwise go for others brands like realme, boat etc",5
This is the best headset I've ever used and the battery backup is just amazing I've been using it for two days and the battery is still there ofcourse its low now but it's still working and I loved it.OnePlus thank-you very much and at last the low latency really works accurate sound with OnePlus phone as I'm using OnePlus 8 I've not tried with other cellphones.Just amazing.,5
"Pure value for money.. Bought one for me and one for my girl.. The best earphone in such a small price. My thoughts were ambivalent before buying this earphones due to mixed responses from the market. But after buying this, I can undoubtedly recommend this to everyone who's looking for a good audio experience with an outstanding battery performance in less charge. Go for it guys.",5
Good sound but not best.  Playing pubg by using this headphone is good. I like it.  Bass lovers not like it.,4
I ordered my product on 28th May..and got this today..delivery was great..now coming to the quality of this headphones.. 1.

First of all packaging was soo good by OnePlus. You get a premium packaging with these 2k priced earphones. Coming to the sound quality it's awesome and dynamic to it's range. Battery has no words to say within just 10 mins of charge you can use it for atleast 10 hours. For OnePlus users it's more comfortable to them because I'm also a OnePlus user. For PUBG mobile if you turn on FNATIC mode you won't get any delay of sound it has very low latency. Overall speaking in of price it's an outstan...,5

"Everything is written in description that's true. sound quality is awesome you will feel real base with this earphone,Awesome thing I have observed that's the battery backup I use this,earphone professionally for my work charge in a once and last for at least 3 to 4 days without issues, Bluetooth version 5.0 is awesome twitch in twitch out work within a second if you are thinking or looking for the good earphone nothing can be better than this go for it",5
"Dont know whats wrong with people who've  been reviewing this 1 star , what more do you expect at this price point . Battery backup is top notch , sound quality is adequate according to the price , fit is so great , build quality is top notch . Little disappointed with low latency mode as it didn't worked as well with my oneplus 5t but as I am upgrading to oneplus 8 pro , so i can expect a better low latency with that device .",5
"So Basically It has terrible bass, great build, excellent battery backup.. if you are that oneplus ecosystem guy then u should buy. Otherwise go for boar or realme for better sound quality. I am happy with the battery backup and build quality. I am one of those OnePlus ecosystem guy and Happy with it.",4

If u want to use oneplus z for listening songs only then this is not for u. U will have more satisfaction after buying JBL T110, JBL T160 WHICH IS WIRED EARPHONES & CHEAPER. But, if we talk about the Bluetooth earphones, then u will have to compromise with something. But for overall use like talking,...",3

Main thing is sound quality, and it is awesome 🥰, now after so long time one plus comes with balanced sound quality. Highs and lows are better. Vocals are clear and soft. No noise a...",4
It's absolutely worth for the money. The packing of the product was cool like every other typical oneplus product. The sound quality is good though the bass is not that good. The design is really good .The quick switch feature is a plus. The battery backup is awesome. You'll get 17-18 hrs. Overall it's a good Bluetooth headset for 2000.,5

Bass just mind blowing and sound, call quality just top notch really very very good in this price range. I just loved it.. Awsome bass, awsome sound quality ???",5
"Don't listen to online review or comparison, it is far better than Realme buds. It is more superior in every section than Realme buds. Best wireless earphone under 2K.",4
THIS IS THE BEST AND BEST PRODUCT I'VE EVER USE.... AFTER USES 4 WIRELESS HEADPHONE I CHOOSE THIS ONE. I AM SATISFIED. I LOVE THIS REALLY.❤️❤️❤️ I WANT YO SAY ALL PEOPLE THIS IS EPIC PRODUCT. REALLY NICE.,5
Wonderful product. Really satisfied with performance of this amazing headset.Thanks Flipkart for super fast delivery.,5
"Its a product that an average person can buy.The bass quality is somewhat ok too me, as i like superbass.The build quality is good, as it is not that heavy around the neck and magnet behind the buds are quite strong to hold them together.Battery life is more than enough to get you through the day, so its worth with the amount you pay to get this product.",5

As I'm using OnePlus NordIt works well with my phoneBass is awesome(as everyone was complaining about bass)I love this headsetBattery life is amazingI don't know about how it works with other phones,5
Awesome neck band....arguably the best in this price range. Sound is balanced and a reasonably good bass is  there but may not be sufficient for bassheads (I have no need to throb my eardrums).Battery is the greatest merit of this band. It's true that it gives 20 hours battery life on charging for just 30 minutes. Casual users like myself only need to charge it once every 3 days. I feel this is the better deal than destroying the ears with high bass.🤩Excellent built and is lightweight..bar...,5
This bluetooth headset is over highlighted by the company as well as by some of our youtubers it is nice headset and mainly for those who are more towards battery as this phone voice quality is good then normal and base it very low with comparision with its competitor realme wireless but the main thing is the build quality a product from oneplus feels like plastic and plastic with that low quality wires which connects the buds where as the build quality of realme is far better then this one .,4

It's been 2 months since I purchased it from Flipkart I haven't felt any discomfort while using it .it doesn't have a great bass but the sound quality is top notch  and loud enough  its battery performance is just superb u can just use it for straight 2 days and it charges quickly from 0 to- 100% within 10 - 20 even on 18 watt charger.its worth every penny you spend on it .,4
"The best bluetooth earphones under 2k. Sound is good , with average bass and pretty good highs. Battery life is amazing. Go for it !2 months later : The one problem I see now is that the device does not automatically connect if your mobile bluetooth is off when you start up your earphones (disconnect them from the magnet). If your mobile bluetooth is switched on, there's no such problem.",5
"Excellent sound signature in this price point. I have seen lot's of reviews or feedback where mentioned ' poor bass or low bass '. Let me point out one thing, the bass is absolutely perfect. I have sennhiser BT 4.50 NC which also having the same type of sound signature, which I love the most. Those who want only BASS and don't care about high n mids, then go for other options but those who wants absolutely pure and balanced sound then go for OnePlus Z.",5

Those people who does not love too much bass..  Then this earphone is perfect for you..  Vocal is pretty much cleared..i hope if you looking to buy then go for it..  It priceworthy.,5
It has been 3 weeks since I am using them so my review is based on what my experience is. My perfect choice among many other available at same price point. Bullets Z are your perfect companion for entire day's usage. Sound quality is awesome. It's loud and clear. Bass is adequate not that punchy but it's totally soothing and distinguishable. Perfect and secure fit with pre applied buds. I have jogged wearing them and they didn't fell from my ears. Build quality is awesome and totally j...,5
"Awesome headset at this price point.Pro:1. Battery backup - you will forget about charging it2. Sound quality - it has the most balanced sound, not too much bass or treble. Excellent clarity.3. Charging - it does charge pretty fast and you can use it for a very long time.4. Magnetic lock on/off switch - its a really convinient feature and saves a lot of battery.Cons: Its not for bassheads as it has a more balanced sound.Other than that, its a really excellent product.Go for it..",5
"Reasons I chose this product:1. Fast charging - Main reason to buy as there is no need to carry additional equipment for charging also, 10 mins of charging gives 10 hours of playback (still needs to be tested)2. Dual Device Pairing - Was also looking for this feature as it makes switching between Laptop and Mobile easy and that too much faster.3. Battery Backup - Gave me 30+ hours of battery backup with 30% battery still remaining since 100% charge.4. Sound Clarity - Nice sound stagin...",4
"Nice product, fine quality material used to make this bluetooth devuce.Compatable with other non one plus mobiles.Long battery backup and sits well in ear.Not much detailed instruction manual is available with this product",5
"Using it with my op6t, overall good performance,, battery life is the most welcome thing.  And sound quality isn't far behind, but still there's options from other brands in this price range, but with all of the perks this one a good value for money, ✌️",4

Best bluetooth earphones under 2000Build quality is awsome  Bass is good Overall sound quality is niceBattery back is best part,5
The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z is a headphone which fills in the gap of a better headphone in 2000 Inr/-.The headphone has a great sound quality.It also has immense amount of battery backup which lasted for complete 2 days with rough usage.This headphone is for audiophiles as the treble and vocals are clear and crisp with perfect bass.The bass is absolutely perfect. It is not very heavy for bass heads but perfect for audiophiles like me.This is the first time that I have ordered a thi...,5
Every is perfect except bass. If it has the better bass quality it would be the best in the business.,4
"Under 2k, it's a good one to buy.Pros-1. Great Battery life2. Good overall sound quality3. Magnetic contol which helps to pause music and disconnect to save battery. Reconnect within 2 sec.4. ConnectivityCons- Comfort- earbuds are not enough grip to hold ears. I tried all 3 sizes.Design- I'm not talking about build quality, since its under 2k. But all controls are placed in left side which I find it difficult. It is good for left hand users.",4
If u r bass lover then dont choose it otherwise its fine( neat & good )  Worth it for money compare others.,4
"Vocals are great but i think the bass is a bit low. Build is great and feels good.Battery backup is also very long, so no frequent charging needed.Overall a great product but i personally would've liked a bit more bass(my previous earphones had better bass, so i guess it will take time getting used to these).",4
"I never thought about getting a Bluetooth headset but after using this I'm satisfied .One of best online electronic purchase that I've ever made About this product : Excellent sound quality and it's not perform a strong base but that's the main highlight . Excellent battery backup ,good building quality, awesome one under this budget",4

"This is my long term review of bullets wireless Z. I've been using it for the past one month. These are one of the best earphones you can get in this price category. Don't go with the negative reviews like there is no bass or something, these are perfectly balanced earphones with very premium quality of sound and i am including bass too.

Very very good earphones 1- Long lasting battery backup 2- 10% to 100% in just 30 minutes of my Samsung charger(15 watt)3- Sound quality is very good     SUPER QUALITY EARPHONES,5
"Enjoying with my One Plus 6 mobile. The feature it has to Power on automatically once the magnets are away and to turn off once the magnets are attached - Just Loved this feature. Disappointed with the Bass. You could only  hear the Bass punch only on High volume and calm surrounding. But the voice clarity for calls is excellent., And the Connectivity is Awesome.",4
Awesome product overall is fine so don't be look back just go for it . sound quality is superb perfermance is mind blowing .One of the Best headset 👍,5
The guy who delivered his a nice man I should Appreciate his work.  and The product is very cool and good design Thanks!,5
Battery backup is awesomeBass is very less means literally poor.Sound quality specially the low and the high pitch is very soothing and of good quality.No call drops at all till now.Build quality is good but I would anytime prefer realme earbuds over one plus if it is the only factor of consideration.But charging time is very-very fast.So friends you get the value for money product.,5
"First of all thanks to Flipkart to on time delivary with out any issues and also my fevourite online shoping app coming to one plus zbullet I m using these z earphones from last three days sound quality was pretty good ,batrey backup is good and also it was comportable to ears  in ky opinion it was giving good performance in all aspects",5
It has excellent build quality with really good battery backup and Sound quality is good but it lacks in good bass which you can find in other earphone and headphones under 2K.But overall a Nice quality Product with brand value of One plus. Best buy for long term usage.,5
It’s good but I am facing one issue where it’s not able to stay connected to my laptop. Like it disconnects after 15 seconds. But it works well with mobile. Not sure how to fix that.,2
"All things are good but sometime having connectivity problem,  even after connecting if i play music then sometime it plays on mobile speaker a second then it reflects in ear pieces. Battery backup is awesome, charging time is too less. Build quality is also good but earpiece wire is not that good. Bass is very lite,  but at all sound quality is too good",4
"Battery is very good , full charge in 50min in warp cherger, bass and sound not high good to woman and old man, not good for music lover, good in price range, you r pubg pleyer so this is good for battery and voice,",4
Really good product on this price. Audio quality are so good and also battery backup on this headset are really awesome .,5
Left side speaker sound is higher than right side's speaker... panning is not right... its bass is powerfull drop base... its better than realme.. coz realme bass is higher but not a dropped bass.. its high frequency bass.. which is not worthy... Oneplus has more accurate Mid range and hight range... i love it... its a good choice... if anyone facing low bass.. use external app for equalizing... you will get full bass❤️,5
"Best ever neckband. I'm waiting for such a product from many years. And including that I'm a OnePlus Phone User since last One year. Not only with OnePlus Phone but also with other Phones, it really gives the best sound clarity and battery life throughout any product in the market. I've given this review after use of 20 days as I brought this on the first sell & proudly I can say that I'm among first 50 users of the product. The instant switch really works great. While coming to sound you...",5
"neckband has a really smooth finish, light weight and a extreme battery life, no one comes close to battery backup and also having a type c port and fast charging capability. Sound quality is really good, i like it's natural sound not like other earphones with extra boost, destroying the clarity",5
Excellent product......I'm very glad to purchase this product...but I'm not satisfied in PUBG mobile sound delay system....so bad..... otherwise it's a very good product.. thanks One plus team to create it......🙂🙂🙂,5
Perfect one...❤️ Best ever package...💝 Best in the price range... No complaints... Except the indicator LED blinking in the night is somehow annoying...,5
Usually I am iritated by head phones but the OP headphone the quite comfortable and doesn't fall off ( I go for cycling wearing it) . I am a person who prefer warm music  so like others mentioned bass is not a prob ( it has adequate bass ). One defect is that the wire provided by one plus is very small but is a type c so u can use the cable u use for ur phone.,5
"Definately sound quality is 100percent better then realme, battery is unbeatable  mine is vivo s1pro I didn't notice sound delay in pubg game u can trust me   worth for money Sound quality is superb",5

But It impressed me a lot As the built quality,bass,fast charging capable, Battery life everything is perfect.. ❤️❤️Its packing is top notch 👌 Got it delivered within 2days nice service by Flipkart team..Just one con is the latency during online gaming like PUBG,COD etc.. 1sec late feels a bit annoying..still they claim it has low latency in OnePlus handsets.. OnePlus has done a great job in this.. don't Think twice just ...",5
OnePlus bullets wireless z is an awesome product. Using it for 5 days now. Sound quality is good taking calls is easy and the call sound quality is also good. Battery backup is insane. I charged it with my power bank for 30 minutes and used it for 4 days without charging. I am not a heavy music listerner but I used for YouTube videos and taking long calls. Overall nice product.,5
Better than Realme buds. I am using with one plus 7T and bass is superb being a bass lover I am giving 5 star.,5

The bullets are fab! The sound quality is damn good for the price . The build is very good as expected from oneplus. The Bluetooth range is very good . Battery backup is too good . It actually gives 10 hrs listening.,5
"Pros : you know that already. cons : It has a decent amount of bass, try changing the buds its , till now no complain. Bass feel even less when the sound is controlled minimum in the headset , even though max volume in your phone. if Bluetooth 5.0 is there in your phone,  then you won't face this issue. will Update this review after 20 days of use.2. ear and head starts paining after 30 minutes of use.",4
"1. Very comfortable to ears.2. Good battery life, get charged pretty quick. 3. Connecting or switching between devices take less than 2 seconds.4. Flexible. 5. Very good call quality. 6.

"Great overall design and looks. I got what i was excited for my first wireless earphones. Sound quality is ok i can say I was expecting more from One plus in that department, battery is excellent. Still thumbs up from my side.",4
"This headset has good sound quality and decent bass. However, some times sound gets distorted at higher volumes. Build quality is decent and headset is very flexible, can be easily put in pocket. Bluetooth range is good and switching between two devices work flawlessly. Battery backup is no doubt best in the market so far. Voice quality during calling is also decent. It connects to my MI A3 very fast as soon as buds are seperated. This headset is not suitable for extreme workouts as buds may ...",4

Awesome product ! Battery backup is really appreciated ... Build quality is good ... about Sound-  4 out of 5 .,5
"Decent product in this price range. Stunning features like switching between paired devices, pause and play with magnetic switch etc. Build quality of the neck band is good and sturdy but of the earphone could be improved. Also more variety of soft ear plugs could have been provided as the smallest size itself was not fitted properly. coming to sound quality, bass is ok (but not heavy) and voice clarity is great.",4
"1 Good Build Quilty & feel premium.2. Crystal clear sound. good balance of Bass & treble. 3. Nice connectivity range. Con.1. The navigation button is very complicated and pathetic. To change a track, need to press single button 2/3 time which is very irritating.  Volume Up/Down buttons can be used for the same as other brand using.2. We can connect one device at a time which is very bad for this device. even Nokia was giving multi-point connectivity in 2012. We need to switch every time...",2

Everything is good about it.I bought this for voice calls & delivers outstanding voice clarity with high pitch volume.Also the music clarity is outstanding.Previously i bought Lenovo HE 18 Bluetooth headphone in this price range but voice quality was very poor & low,it was very tough to trace volume in a room also.I will highly recommend this oneplus bullets headphone. Its owesome,just go for it.",5

Only one demerit: Can't connect to 2 simultaneous device, need to switch it manually by OP switch button on the Bullets Z",2
This is my first impression.  It is the best bluetooth which i have used in terms of practical usage .Those who use earphones mainly fir calling purpose these have the best experience other person can't find that you are  using a proper earphones or a bluetooth headset seriously and the battery is also a good advantage you have to charge ones and easily spend ur full day and night with these bluetooth earphones.,5

"Using this since two weeks now...at first I was disappointed as the sound quality was not up to the mark as per my expectations but then I changed my ear buds with the ones which fits perfectly. Then I have to say the sound quality is very good and the bass too. So it’s recommended that before start using it please check the ear buds (2 extra sets given in the box) which fit you the best. Next I would like to say that the mic quality is also good, no problem in receiving calls or dropping cal...",4
"Awesome battery backup for me it lasted for 2 days of approx 7-8 hours daily on 70-75% volume so it can last upto 24-26 hrs, trust me i am in love with this product and sound quality and mic quality is also good, bass is good enough to not damage ur ears ( I feel it's a complete package)",5

I bought this earphone(one plus bullet z) hesitantly as l am new to Bluetooth headsets and used to think that it is of lesser quality than the wired ones but I was wrong. This is of very good quality both sound and battery life. The mids, the lows and the highs are at equilibrium nothing is more or less ,though not recommended for bass he...",5
"This is really worth every penny. The sound is pretty good and the battery is just awesome, it gives long hours of listening. The only downside is the bass which is little but considering the bright sides it is fine. Everyone looking for a premium feel with budget under 2k, this is the best choice. Also getting one plus product at this rate is just amazing.",5
Ordered it on 23rd july and received on 31july.. Not complaining coz delay might be due to lockdown... Talking about the earphone now...:- * Build quality is awesome in its price range(as its OnePlus)*Earbuds are soft comfortable also the weight of the earphone is negligible feels not wearing anything*Not yet used that long but surely it last for more than 18hrs..*Connectivity:- I am using OnePlus 6 and it connects with it flawlessly... But when you untuck  the magnet it takes about 5 sec...,5

Insane..!Playing games with this headset is awesome.This is not for bass head, so if you are fan of bass, i would not suggest this, but audio clarity is very good.",5
All features is awesome but base is not sufficient although very good but not better,5
"May be my expectations from oneplus was a bit too much it didn’t quite live upto it.. for an audiophile this is a below average product and you might give it a miss. Pros- cheap price, good built, very flexible body, water resistance, Fast connectivity and good battery life. Thanks for reading!",2
"Good Sound Quality. Base is little less but okay, not an big issue. Perfect for office use as well as for home use. Charges 100% in 40 mins with normal 2 Amp charger. All functions working fine. Just OnePlus should start manufacturing in India or any other country than China.",5
The battery backup is insane and the quick pair is also quite good but the bass is not as expected and it needs to be improved and over all build quality is nice and it's a great value for money,5
"Fast delivery by flipkart, bass is good, vocals are clear, build quality is good, battery back-up is decent, lightning speed of charging speed these all makes worthy to buy.And also for gaming it works with fnatic mode (one plus device only) very well.No wireless earphone can compete with this in this price range.",5

Battery, Lasts more than 14 hrs with moderate uses and about 10 hrs with continuous listening music. I'm quite happy with this headset. Only one thing which I didn't like about it it's magnet. Magnet is not so good, it's just automatically separate with a soft touch and because of it sometimes it uses all battery.",4

"The earphones are good and worthy for Rs.1999. They give best experience for recorded videos, calls, online conferences and lectures of children.But they are not suitable for gaming if you don't have a latest OnePlus phone.Pair seamlessly with smartphones, but connecting to a COMPUTER is quite time taking. They don't connect seamlessly with COMPUTERSMust buy if your Budget is under Rs.2000.The shittest part is that they are made in china.",4

For a full charge, I used it for 16-17hours and still i had 10percent left in it. And coming to bass, everyone said bass is not there, but from mu view, bass is really good and everyone will like it Its not tooooo punchy like a woofer, but its really good for a Bluetooth headset.Best buy and tremendous value for money.!!!",5

"It is just okay. Cannot say a great product to use, but a basic fit for ease of use. Connectivity has a bit issue. If you are heavy user of managing calls then it's not a fit.Quick switch feature is a great one but sometimes it shows a bit lag (it depends on how many times you switch over to other device).",3
Awesome product by OnePlus .. Definitely nailed it ...1)Insane Battery backup 2)Nice microphone worth for the profressional meetings 3)Very Robust 4) Dual device switching is just wow 5) Very comfortable.,5
Many YouTubers have said in many ways that the base is not good but the base is very good and the battery backup is 100% Satisfied like NEVER BEFORE EVER AFTER,5
One plus blutooth headset is valuable for money as per my observation Sound good quality Product Designe good Bass asper the standered Magnetic control new feature it also good Battery backup also good So finally it better in blutooth device,4
"Good Choice but it just kinda gets the ears covered totally that it feels like there is no air flow which creates a pressure in your ears like slight humming... anyway it's good ,go for it",4
Bass is slightly low but overall nice battery backup super I use oraimo neckless 2 but oraimo bass is best than one plus bullet wireless z after all a good package slightly low sound,4

"One of the best and most affordable earphone in the market. Really nice built, feels smooth over the neck. Latency is amazingly low, instant connect with phone, specially OnePlus devices. Bass can be improved, but for 2k, that's too much to expect. Overall, must buy in this price point",5
One of the best in town. Rugged and great sound.Interference is minimal. Good choice if you focus on sound quality and not on looks.,5

These headset sounds good not that amazing at this price range and also the earbuds fit are not good and comfortable. Build quality and battery life are amazing,4
"Looks good, sound quality awesome but bass is little low but over all perfect design by One +, i have One+ 7 handset and it support successfully.....4.5/5",5
"Let's start with the build quality, it is excellent given the price point and I didn't at all feel like I was using a cheap product, I've been using it rather ruggedly since list month or so and it shows no sign of wear.The sound quality is good too with no exagerated frequencies, yeah I am talking to you bass heads who like a woofer dangling on your neck this ain't for you.I am not at all saying the bass is bad it's probably not good enough for many.also if you want a more premium feel ...",5
Good sound quality by the oneplus team I really love it and well package worth for money,5

oneplus headset battery backup is awesome and sound is good and smooth and design cool very good so awesome product,5
Excellent. Every one says no bass. But use correct size ear buds. Bass is very decent. Sound clarity no words to say. Only pro is volume control and mic has been given Seperately. Excellent call quality. Simply superb.,5
It is nice product. good charging speed and amazing battery backup .but it has no base as like other products,5
"Great battery life and build quality, crystal clear sound(bass is avg), comfortable fit, pretty fast charging.. just go for it.If your 1st priority is bass then go for the realme  ones or oppo enco m31.Note- you don't need oneplus warp charger for fast charging -Fast charge your Bullets Wireless Z with ease using a standard adapter* and Type-C USB charging cable. *Requires 5V / 600 mA",5
One of the best in the available price range. Have used boat rockers before. This one is much better as it saves the battery and back up is also good. 10mins charging certainly lasts long.,5
"Good quality product but less on bass, I liked the sound output of my Boat Bluetooth headphones. I bought this for my wife and even she liked the sound output of my Boat headphones better than this. But OnePlus has better look and feel compared to Boat and the dedicated button to switch between devices is an advantage here.",4
first i would like thanks flipkart for superfast delivery and secondly i would like to thanks one plus for such a nice earphone at this price.Very crystal clear sound deep bass super battery backup.its truly incredible,5
"After using one week, I can recommend this product because Its Battery Backup is awesome, by stand by use of 8 hours daily, it can easily last for atleast 5 to 6 days. Sound quaility is even that much best, all type of music feels melodious. Bulit quality is also superb and it is easy to access. Only thing should be considered is its length, it is longer to handle while working. But overall, full marks..",5
This is wonderful product. Very good build and quality. Received yesterday so can not say cannot say about battery backup however used for around 2 to 3 hrs still showing battery 100%. In many reviews on YouTube and on other platforms and also in feedback most of them are telling about sound that BASS is not good. But I say BASS is really very good and sound is very balanced. BASS more then this will spoil the sound. So overall great product in all the parameters. And dual pairing and shift...,5

Sound signature is  balanced which to some users may seem lacking in bass , for me it was Good enough .

"* I have been using Realme neckband and then I got this one. The only edge realme has on this one is bass. But you can compromise that for clear and crisp sound of oneplus. * Calling quality is way better than realme. Battery backup is awesome and quick charge is a treat that you can’t ignore. * Weight is low, so you will be comfortable with wearing it for a day or two. Earbuds’ shape is designed well, so that they won’t come out of ears. * Noise cancellation is done well. The person on th...",5
"One of the best headset that I have ever used,Bass is bit on the downside.But that is ok.If you have paired this headset with multiple device,there is a switch to simply toggle between device.In laptop it connects as 2 mode, headset mode(volumne button works in this mode) and wireless mode(volume buton dosent work in this mode)Overall its a best headset.Buy it without second thought.",5

"My 2 day use review. Will update the review after 1 mnth usage. Buying this I was very skeptical as I always wanted a good pair of earphones having super music effects & good clarity of audio & calls & believe me this one ticks all the right boxes. The bass, the connection speed, overall comfort, the battery backup, the music feel & call clarity all as expectation. The bass was pretty surprising to me, i did not expect it to be this good. I have heard boat rockerz, realme buds but did not fin...",5
Design is very good battery backup is awesome sound quality is quite good but vocal music is sweet sound.,5
Who don't love the bass at extreme then go for it..... Because except high bass all features are like 5 star ....it doesn't mean there is no bass.... Sufficient bass is provided,4

Worth the price . Battery life is amazing and sound quality is decent . Not too much bass but balanced sound.,5
One of the best in its price segment! Great performance. Great sound quality and bass is also fair ( not that bad ). Vocals are just amazing. And battery backup is impressive. If you are looking for great pair of neckband at this price segment then this is it! Just go for it!,5
"I experienced delivery problem. They didn't deliver to my village. They asked me to come nearest Town and collect it.Other than that Product is awesome good sound quality, better build quality and design and excellent Battery backup.",4
Good enough in this budget range. Bass is good according to price. Just love it.,4
One small problem in this headset is bass but sound is very clean and balanced so i like it this headset and second is battery backup is super and built quality is good just one pro is bass which is just less compare other headsets otherwise this product is good,4
i will really recommend to everyone because everyone needs budget flagships and this is the one of them i love it for sound quality i will give 4.5/5 no compromise in it for build quality i will give 4.5/5 because build quality gives you a premiumness in it i love it and for bass 4.2/5 not much louder bass that we wanted from it soo and vocals are also good mids and highs are perfect but lows are little but disturbing soo thats itt if my review gives you a great suggestion then give like,5
"Got the delivery of product within 2 days even earlier than estimated date , I'm so grateful to the Flipkart team providing us with the availability of stuff even during such a pandemic and prompt channel !!!About the product 1. First of all if you are into BASS this one is definitely not for you ( as in my case , it was a big turn off for me )2. The battery backup is amazing , I got completely discharged set , but just pinned the set to charger for 3 minutes and it's battery was restored ...",2
"The sound quality is good, the soundstage is very balanced and thus delivers good vocals and clear instrument seperation. Bass is not that overwhelming as compared to other products. Overall a great product especially if you have a oneplus device as it offers dash charging and low latency mode. Only drawback in my opinion is that there are other equally good wireless headphones at this price range or bellow(like those realme ones) and if you don't have oneplus phone getting this is not that b...",4

Sound was very clearer compared to realms buds but if you are bass lover go for realme buds orelse desently oneplus is quite good awesome product,5
Honest review :Pros : 1. Battery back up and charging 2. Best for calling 3. Good connectivity 4. Good design 5. Features Cons :1. Music lovers stay away as Rs. 200 wala roadside headphone will give you better base and sound clarity.2. Latency observed .0.8 sec so bad news for pubg lovers. Overall if you have calling related  specific requirement then only go for these or else you will be disappointed. Do not go fir these if picking for gaming,3
Good earphones but i think sound is little bit low but if it is higher then no one is going to keep at full volume so i think  it is great no stress toh ears good comfort.... Just go for it,5
"A superb one. Battery. Connectivity, Charging time All too good. Not a great fit to my ear but it is ok. I love the seamless bluetooth switching between two devices. Auto power off if removed and attached to magnets.Sound Quality is good too for the price.",4
bad in sound quality bad in bass you can say no bass and mic is the low quality even 100 rs earphone have better mic .. but good battery best and fast connection easy.. good built quality,3
"It sounds pretty good 😊. If you are kind of person who needs more battery backup then go for it, although the bass is not that good",5
Beast yeah you are looking correctly BEAST in charging back-up and charging too.Design should even more better . Sound quality is good but bass haven't reached expectation(4/5) for bass.While playing pubg there will be lag in sound in milli seconds but with thi headset I haven't found any sound lag even in normal gaming mode . I liked it .. Price is also low compared to another bluetooth headset's .,5
"Excellent build quality and excellent battery backup.If you are having low bass output, try different ear tip from different companies.Experiment a little. Everyone's ears are different. I used ear tips from my old Mi Basic earphones and got excellent bass.And quick switch feature is a major plus point. I use it to quickly switch from my work laptop to my phone wheneven need to answer a call.",5

I'm loving it.... It's been 13days & I charged only twice... Magnetic switch added advantage... Works upto 12m range... For sound I would rate 9.5/10... Bass is better but not best... Physical 9/10...,5
"Good product in this price. But on off functionality are not very user friendly. Switch device facility is really good. Sound quality is soothing. Battery backup is good. But for first few days charging time was taking 30min as mentioned in the description. But after few days it is taking more than 45min to full charge with warp charger. I think this headphone is good if you have Oneplus mobile also, because you can get updates also for better performance.",4
Owsam product good quality excellent power back up.... perfect sound thank you flipkart,5
"Great is this price range.. Great sound , great battery backup, super comfortable while using.. I can use it 3-4 hours straight without any discomfort..Go for it .. u won't regret.",5
Awesome bluetooth earphones I have used till now. Sound quality was great especially the instruments and vocals are very good and bass is little less sufficient for me. When comes to battery backup it has nailed all other bluetooth earphones charged for 10mins I often travel listen music on the go it was perfect and gave me three days backup. Tq flipkart for early delivery.,5

"Good sound quality, well balance all the things , nice feature switch 1 device to another by double click.Battery backup is excellent once you charge it fully you can use it 3 days.",4
Okay so apart from heavy bass which I do not prefer everything about this earphone is top notch. It has worked wonders in charging and battery backup department. Overall best buy at 2k,4
Value for money its working fine and best bass headphone i was using boult but this is far better than that headphone.. Worth buying it,5
I expected Little bit decent bass from one plus like sony/jbl For music lovers it is not as good as sony and jbl,5
"I am using this product for the last 15 days and I have gotta admit its awesome. The sound quality is well tuned and it produces a very balanced sound which I have been looking for in a Bluetooth headset.Audio is crisp and clear with good high and mid tones and a decent bass. Battery backup is decent. You can listen to music,attend calls and play games for hours without fatigue in your ears with this headset. There is hardly any room for complain but if i have to pick any woo of this earphone...",4
"This might be one of the most perfectly sounding headphones... BASS IS NOT LOUDEST BUT DEEP & IMMENSE TO PUMP AUDIO... people who prefer excellent balanced sound... close your eyes and order. I don't need to talk about other aspects like battery performance, call quality, switch device and latency mode features as they can beat any competition in the price range. GO FOR IT...!",5
First is bettery life superb if its full low and you want to go out st charge till you change and get ready  by wrap chager .. but sounds does not good  that much  if you are music lover dont go for it because sound not good no boss no echo,4
Best earphones in the market if you already own a one plus phone. Syncing with the the phones is effortless and fast charge support is an icing on the cake. You cannot go wrong with this pair of earphones if you already own a one plus phone.,5
It's just awesome 😊 loved it..and the battery is just awesome..last upto 4-5 days after full charging..OnePlus says 10mins charge and 10hrs backup and u can't believe that they mean it...it's works wonderful❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍,5

An excellent one..am using this for my realme 3pro...and it work perfectly (in gaming also *pubg).batteey backup is excellent...and the warp charge support is also amazing.,5
"This earphones are truly amazing to go with. It is what it claims on the box. Clear sound, soothing bass, built quality 10/10, looks 10/10, comfortable for longer hours, very very light weight, soft and premium touch of band and wires. If the price fit's in your pocket. Definitely Go with it at this price you can't get anything better than this.",5
Over all product is best value for money. Sound is good only lack of bass for music lover otherwise product is fantastic and battery backup really awesome.,3
Awesome sound quality. Looks give you a premium feel and an edge over other competing products. Build quality is fine bt can be improved a little more...just a little more.... Overall a good product... Its a go guys! You can opt for it without any hesitation,4
"Sound quality is pretty good,‍ bass is decent( not for deep high bass listeners)..The built quality is amazing & the battery backup is also great",5
I reviewed this product after using 20 days. 1. It is good in term of battery hold upto 10 hour while I using continuously.2. If you love music go for Boat Rocker 225 it is best.3. It has decent sound quality.4. It also lag sound with video.,3
"Best battery quality , good sound with decent bass , totally worthy product.",4
Overall good but not great. Sometimes it comes out from ear if you are running or doing workouts. Bass is not good at all. Battery backup is great whereas plastic body does make it too appealing.,4
If you are bass lover  and need heavy bass pls don't go for it but sound is so clear you will love it,5
"5 star for flipkart delivery .Sound and build quality is pretty good but can't claim same for the bass.one more thing m not satisfied with comfort level ,most of the time it feels like they are falling .I will update my review after some month",5
"Design and build quality are good. Battery is awesome. Fast charging is also good. Not good for high bass lovers, because of low bass. Soft music lovers can buy. For calling purpose, it is best.",5
Too good i am soo happy its a such a good product  thank you one plus and Flipkart,5
"I'm using this from last 12 days And I really ? love this. Because of its sound quality. I would say that sounds of this Bluetooth is best in this price segment. Bass is also good and i feel the clarity in the bass. When i saw the review every one says that bass low, but when i use this i can say that everyone telling lies and battry backup is awesome. It's rubber band is very handy because i can put it in my pocket very easily without getting any damages. I would say just go for it.",5
Such  beautiful headphones...if you are not that used to listening music and use this for work this 1 is just beyond perfect....truely amazing ...,5
They have the best features and the best battery backup in thisclass nd just buy them if you can compromise with the bass and want a good battery backup,5
Truly satisfied by sound quality and the features... comfortable to wear for long hours....best battery life...people are talking that bass is not so good but I would like to say that it's good...reaches the expectations...loved the sound over all...it's perfect...not so low not so high...just perfect.,5
Amazing battery backup coupled with decent build quality. Though the sound quality especially the bass leaves a lot to be desired. Even while watching stuff on Netflix i felt that the volume level and output is not up to the mark. The ability to pair with two devices and switching between them on the fly works like a charm and is a great feature. The pause/play by connecting / disconnecting the magnetic earpieces is also a fairly convenient feature to have. Do note that if you're a bass-hea...,4
Just got this headset about 1 week ago. It's awesome. Battery backup is excellent. If you use the headset just for listening to music it will easily play for good 10-12 hrs non stop. Charging is awesome as well - full charge in 10min. Love the product.,5
"Really Excellent.This is my first ever OnePlus product and my experience is really amazing. I am writing this review after 10 days of its use.....though i am not a thumping bass lover, still the bass is sufficient in this device....no issues at all...but if you are a hard core bass lover and a freak only of bass, then this is not for you bro.....i am totally satisfied with its overall sound output, the vocal and instruments are quite prominent and clearer. And loudness is enough. You will de...",5
Amazing Battery Backup lasting upto 4-5 with normal usage.Definitely worth the price.Bass quality is good for the price plus Quick Switch between devices is such handy feature.Fit and finish and rubber neckband feels premium.Best Bluetooth Handsfree Under 2000.,5
"I'm using this for around 3 weeks.. I'm fully satisfied with my purchase.. excellent sound quality , massive battery compared to some other Bluetooth headsets.. neat design. go for this.. definitely a value for money",5
"Mind blowing product , great sound quality, bass is not to heavy but not that much lower , vocals are clear , i have used for almost about 4 hrs continuously so comfort level is also very good",5
"No doubt these are the best earphones in this price range sound quality is better than most,bass could've 10% better but trust me sound quality is the best... although equilizer helps alot... overall these are genuinely good",5
This is one of a terrific product in market for one plus users😍😍 . Those who say this doest have good bass just try these headsets on a one plus device you will feel what the real bass which this product gives❤️❤️. Battery backup which none of the device in this price segment can provide or have offered till date. I can easily use this device for a 22 hrs.❤️❤️,5
Battery back is amazing and sound quality is good. I don't like bass so it's a great product for me. Guys you can purchase this item without hesitation.,5
Definitely not worth for the music lovers who loves bass and effects.... Just suitable to take calls with good battery backup.. that is it...I wouldn't suggest this for gamers or music lovers.,2
Unparalleled Battey Backup . Very Low Latency while playing games like PUBG. Overall music is pretty balanced. Must buy. Realme Buds Wireless has better build quality. But OnePlus just beats it in battery backup and features.,5
The build could have been better. At least the wires coming out of the main frame should have been more robust. Battery is awesome as advertised. Very light weight. Also neck band should have been a little more rigid. Sound is okay. Works for me and very good for calls. Unless you're a die hard music buff who wants crystal clear audio on every beat... This is the headphone for you.,4
one of the best earphones ever bought. premium build quality with exquisite look. Bass could be a thing to be worked on. Rest everything is fine.,5
"It's awesome headset guys. I'm been using this two weeks and amazing battery backup and awesome sound. For those who are saying it has no bass that is completely wrong. It includes decent bass, i think you are not experiencing bass becz of earbud. I just replace one plus earbud with my sennheiser small earbud.. Guys you must try the differents.. Bass is just boosted and i cant believe it..Must by budget Bluetooth headset with incredible battery backup.",5
Very delighted to use these headsets. Most useful for corporate use. Works for me.. Thank you 🙂,5
Talking about the pros:1.Build quality is nice and superior in this price range. 2. Battery backup is excellent. 3. Got c port charger which charges very quickly. Cons: 1. For bass lovers this is not the product for u. 2. Mic quality is decent not that great as compared to the other products.,5
The sound quality is very good and balanced. Battery backup is as per claimed. In a word its a great bluetooth earphones and great deal in 2k price range.,5
Very good earphone by one plus in this range.  Bass level iss moderate not too good but every thing is too good,5
Very well balanced and good connectivity support alongwith immense battery life...,5
Apart is bass everything is great. Bass is just good not that great. Best quality I liked that you can actually switch between your devices with a double click button on your headset. Go for it.,5
From the time I got this to till now after using more than 6 hours I can say that it is performing very well. Good product but the thin cable used for headphone buds are not so impressive at all. I have still doubt about their durability. Though most of the time it remains out of the stock for its high demand on Flipcart. Finally I got this. Delivery is early before the date. Oneplus box pakaging is very very good but pakaging from flipcart is avarage. Thank god it got no damage. Afterall thi...,5
Excellent product. Better than expected. Best buy in this price range and best in the segment. Good work oneplus.,5
Bass is enough but sound quality would be little more clear.. For good quality of bass use bass booster app.. It will help you to produce a good quality of bass.. And enjoy,4
"Battery backup is amazing, easily running for more than 10-20 hrs.Sound quality is too good, i don't know why some people say bass is not good.. Amazing sound..Its great deal in this using for work outs.. keeping my phone in ground floor, connectivity to 1st floor is seamless..Go for it, quality headset.",5
The design is neat. The sound quality is good and the vocals are really good.However if you are a gamer then I'd not recommend this due to latency.I mean it's really bad. Atleast a delay of 1sec and that really mattera if you are a Pro player.The low patency mode is only available for the Oneplus devices only.,5
Most advanced and budget earphones are here!!If you need best bass and sound wid avg charging time then go for realme buds @1800.If you need best avg bass and sound wid quick charging time then go for this💯💯,4
It's actually deserve 4 star because of less bass.But according to price we can manage it.So it's a 5 star product.It's good that you get enough features and very good sound quality but best feature is10 minute charge & you will get more than 9 hour battery backup and another is you can switch the connection from mobile to laptop or any other device easily and it is automatically connected.,5
"Overall it has got very balanced sound signature. Bass is there but little low. Not an ideal product for bassheads.Very good for listening acoustic music.Very lightweight, build quality is very nice. Even after using it for long time no problems like pain in ear observed.Switching between works flawlessly, it just takes 1 sec. Call quality from mic is pretty good.",5
Awesome purchase. Much better than Realme Wireless and Boat wireless that i had. Noise cancellation is almost much better any other bluetooth wireless that i had.. Back-up is super cool.,5
"Bass is a bit low . Quality is great , including calls . Battery is unbelievably great , atleast 15 hours and charges completely in around 40 minutes. Connects seamlessly to iPhones also, quick turn on/off based on magnet is working too. Changing the active device , like switching to phone to attend a call , while listening to music to laptop , is very quick .You just double tap, and the connection is changed in 2-3 seconds. Overall, a great buy.",5
Good product with good sound and good price and all.I love it 😍😍😍😎😎😘😘,4
Super se uper wala product great battery life great sound quality i loving it😍😍👌,5
"Everything is perfect about the product except the battery life for me. I think may be my headset is defective. It is not giving that much battery back up what mentioned. Probably 8 hr maximum for my case. I don't listen with very loud sound too. Charging speed is good, only battery backup is less for me. It has very good sound quality, even better than my Sennheiser cx 275s. Bass is also great. I like is type of deep bass. I don't know why people are blaming it for low bass.",4
"Awasome product,  bass should be improve in it but enough bass to hear clear & fresh music. Sound quality is best.",4
"This is an excellent wireless earphone. I should admit that Sound quality is fabulous & also the Bass is preety good. It's a balance sound quality. When it's come to Charging quality, it has the most playback time I ever seen any earphone. This earphone totally money worthy. Thanks OnePlus for give us this well featured earphone. I'm recommending everyone to buy this OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bluetooth Headset. Love this earphone yaar ❤️❤️❤️❤️",5
The battery life of product is amazing and descent sound quality and bass. The bass is good but not the best i would say,5
"Killer in this price rangeThis is my first Bluetooth headset and I was intialy confused between Realme buds and oneplus z, but after looking at quite a bit of comparison videos on youtube i decided to go for it.The sound quality is apt for my taste, it's quite balanced and yes it is lower on base, the battery backup and the build quality is top notch, credit OnePlus, it get charged quickly and if you use it at 70% volume it will easily last for 18hours and it's quite comfortable to wear ev...",5
"Good product at this price but it's bass is not satisfactory, all over sound quality is balanced it feels premium on hand and feels good... All over a good choice for taking calls and some casual music",4
It's a good product. Sound quality is good 9/10. Bass is average 7/10. But it's a very good product. Love it.,4
"Great battery,great design, build quality is also best at this priceThe only reason I gave 2 star is ""noise cancellation"" its not good at all and I observed it stops working sometimes.",2
I loved it after using 1 week. Below are the points which I liked and loved most.1. Quick switch2. Battery backup3. Quick Charge even with my VOOC charger,5
"First of all, Sound quality is 9/10Bass, I love bass but when it comes to bullet z we can definitely sacrifice 30% of bass over Its features and battery life.Most of them will prefer Bass for its Thump but if you just want ONLY BASS not the features, sound quality  and best battery then don't take ONEPLUS BULLET Z.ONEPLUS BULLET Z stands out with all other Features except BASS.. I loved it ..just go for it give it a try if you don't just Return it that's it..",5
"Good earphone from one plus.sound quality is balanced ,voice call quality is also good,I love 10 minutes charge to get 10 hrs playback & lastly 20hrs backup thing is awsm.I bought from flipkart ,they deliver here fastest & delivery guy is so nice , cordial",4
Bass is really good don't go for realme just for bass all those reviews on youtube are baseless. Switch button is magic and battery backup is amazing,5
Just go for it..if u want to buy bluetooth neckband..really impressive with the product in this prize range..sound quality is perfect however it will be little disappointed for the person who used to listen music with heavy bass.but over-all it value for money..keep it mind that its from best branded company...,5
"As i expected as i want! Amazing sound quality but not for those who prefer bass, its batter backup is around 18 to 18.5 hrs which was really awesome. Build quality is quite nice, if i compare this whit realme neckband then ofcourse  both are same at some places and different at some,like the one who prefer bass go for realme neckband, otherwise if the bass is not the necessary part of your neckband the go for it(oneplus wireless bullets z)",5
"awesome product.all features are available in this earphone and i put my reviews after three days,battery backup is too good if you 100% charge earphone  then use are use continue three days. after three days you can will charge your earphone.charging system is so fast i am charge my earohone from samsung adopter 25 watt, maximum full charging time under 40 min",4
"Well not a bad choice at all for 2k...Remember if you are a bass lover ,,, never  chose this...Bulletz are for those who have daily usage of headset like in online conference and online classes.. after 4 days usage I find it quite reliable as the battery backup is top notch.. at medium level of sound u could get upto 17/18 hour's of playback... Comfortable design and build quality.. btw latency wasn't there for me at all... Connectivity and quick switch works a bit late than expected.. Ove...",4
Nice bild quality and battery life is awesome..Sound is good not great but overall nice products,4
"I am reviewing after a week of usage.1. Build quality is great I really like it.2. Battery backup is really awesome got a good battery backup it lasted me for more than two days. Also, charging speed is good.3. Sound quality is great vocals and music is pretty clear just a bass is little less but won't disappoint.",4
"Good product worth for money, Good battery backup Call clarity good But noise cancellation not good while  traveling air sound is high",4
"The best bluetooth headphone one can ever have, just go for it. No need to think twice. Best Battery Backup, the best sound quality, i will recommend this to everyone.",5
"Best product from one plus and Best Price, Everything Good and Good battery Backup up to 2 days",4
This is not good for heavy bass user.. it's very easy to use.. battery backup is awsome and also it's quick charge feature is very handy... Low latency feature only works in OnePlus devices and that too is not good.. so for playing pubg it's not good..,4
"Sturdy and light weight. Voice clarity and sound quality both are very good for its price. Battery backup is excellent, it lasted for 6 days after full charge. Rubberized neck band is very comfortable and ear buds fit nicely in your ears. Switching between 2 paired devices is breeze. Overall preety good earphones for its price",5
"There is no any negative review for this and it is very good whatever I will tell it will not be enough for this product, you must go for this, you will love this sound quality it quality is top of the notch.",5
Design and function is very good... Happy with battery backup.... But if you are a bass lover then this is not very good choice..overall Sound quality is good,3
excellent bass and good for playing pubg somr creepy sounds are being heard while playing pubg when compared to samsung level U this is much better ....worth for money charging performance are so good and battery backup also,4
Delivery is very fast its been an fabulous to buy  oneplus headphones two in week..so happy about Flipkart service..one plus Good jog again,4
Been about a month since I got them and I must say I'm impressed. I'll address some less answered questions here. I am using these on my Oneplus 7 device and performance may vary on devices other than OnePlus phones.Q. Does it work for gaming like Pubg?A. Yes it does. You'll experience a minor lag in sound but I think it's ignorable after an update OnePlus pushed for these earphones. The lag is negligible. For credibility purposes I have a K/D of 5 and I'm fine in playing with these earphon...,5
The battery backup and sound quality is good but you. may face connectivity issue if you resume the device after a long break.I have been using it continuously for last 7 days and have charged it only 3times. So 5/5 fot the battery backup.It doesn't have Noise cancellation but still works fine for calls. Overall a good product!,3
Those are tlod bass is not enough ... then can't  afford  Dolby  & beats audio that for clarity  not only bass ..,5
"For rs 2000, it's best. Sound quality is very good,.Bass, tribble, low frequency sound and instrumental separations and all things are good. The best things about it. It's battery and it's connectivity. And it's best comfortable under 2000 rs range. You can easily hear at its high volume and your ears not gonna be hurt. Overall best",5
"Sound is awesome. call clarity is good. Microphone has good sound while calling, but when recording sound is very low. Not good for sending voice messages or recording",4
"This Wireless Z has good vocals clarity and good bass for those who is using one plus mobiles.But, for non one plus users may feel bad if they buy this as it will be no use for them.The battery backup is good for all the users.",4
"The earphone are pretty nice, design is good and the cable looks beautiful at the same time it's, well packed and anti tangled feature is really helpful. So overall a nice product and it' worth its money. 1- Battery backup is superb2- so much lighten in weight3- fast connectivity4- one of the best earphone I had ever use in this prize range.5- just go for it All thanks for flipkart for prompt delivery (order date - 01 June 2020 and delivery date- 04 June 2020)",5
Amazing product😍😍🤗. Value for money. Loving it. Features are Amazing. Once I charged 100% n it last for me 2 days for Regular usage (Not continuous). Totally Satisfied with One Plus 😍😘😘😘😘💞🎉🎊🤘😎,5
If you r searching for a earphone which have balanced sound and clear vocal and instrumentals then this is for uAnd if anybody want to know about bass this have deep bass not like the boult loop wired earphone (those who want some base to compare) this have deep bass.Thnku,3

When I heard about this earphones in launch event. I was eagerly waiting to buy this earphones but when i heard about the price in india.I was waiting for the availability in india.so after using this for a while. I was totally dissatisfied with it. I didn't expect this from one plusFirst will go to pros:1)Battery life:At this price range it's best for its battery life .Not only for 2k if you go around 3k also you won't find this much battery life.so one time charge can give you seamless us...,5
Awesome earphones bass is not good. If you like to listen to some bass boosted music then these are not the right earphones for you.,5
At this price one plus is the best neckband ever .. warp charge is amazing .... 10 minutes charge 10 hours of play back it really works .. we can charge this with normal 5w charger .. and sound quality is awesome Built quality is bang on .. in this price ... Guy's definitely go for it ... This is the best earphones in this price ... I loved it ✌️😉👌👌,5

All are perfect bass is low but to change settings then better bass. Wink music to better experience to listening music all are perfect sound delivery,5
Worth every penny. Excellent quality with good sound output. Great job by one plus.,5
All Rounder Earphones1 Sound quality: These provide a very rich and balanced soundstage. Lows(base) are not much amplified as per the Indian liking. But it can be tweaked easily with a device in built equalizer. Sound output ie loudness is very good 2 Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0 provides a stable connection throughout. Calls were clear and no drops were encountered.  The range is also pretty good. You are able to walk around an entire floor of a 1000 sqft house.3 Mic Microphone does not ...,4
I really amazed how fast this charge in 25 minutes that give you 18.5 hours backup that's really great but a little thing that I don't like it if you use this for more than 2 or 3 hours that will give you some little pain on years,4
"Beyond perfection, I love it , best bluetooth headset I've ever heard at this price point its frikin steal man, best instrument seperation very good bass, bass is not at the top but it definitely there were your expectation is. Overall i would say its a premium product at a very low budget hats off to op team",5
it's worth and this is the highest quality bluetooth headset . I'm very happy to see first time and I reliesed it's very good quality😊😊😊,5
Very good product. The design is good and it's very comfortable. The pairing process is simple. Sound quality is also very good with good bass. Battery backup is amazing. Highly recommended.,5
This is perfect Budgeted Earphones. Sound is awesome. Crstal clear voice. Calling experience  is Good. Range of bluetooth is Good. Thanks to Flipkart. Packing was Fabulous....! Love this product....! ?????,5
"If you are a bass lover then don't go for it , everything else is superb , easy to use , great battery life , great design , best is comfortable in ear ..",4
Sound is good base is average and ya u notice a sound lag in game like COD and PUBG so not recommended for gaming but except gaming it's good and battery backup is awesome,4
Wonderful Bluetooth earphone by OnePlus.. Sound quality is awesome. Crisp and clear... It would have been better if the bass was more... Otherwise all ok,5
"Everything Is Good In It. It is confertable, Powerful battery backup but i have only cut 1 star because of bass i will suggest you that if you want this only for music and not for other purpose like fast charging then go for other one available. Overall it is nice and very comfortable.And Bass Is Not That Bad But In This Price Range You Will Get Better Bass But Not This Fast Charing.",5
"Very nice headset, oneplus had considered every aspect that customer complains.. This headset is very amazing.. Premium sound, nice quality of material, couple of good features and pretty amazing price. Very good",5
Overall sound quality is good but it lacks bass in when the volume is below 50 % u can feel it but it's not that noticeable. Coming upon to battery backup it's a bliss that I charged it for every 2 days nd i use them at the 80% volume nd that's great of the backup. Now for the connectivity it's also soo god that when u seperate the buds within 2 seconds they get connected with the device just the time taken to seperate the buds and place the both buds in your ears.Over all its soo good and I...,4

Perfect headphones for general and gaming use no latency in pubg battery backup is the best you can get in any price range base is good not for those who just want base and no clarity overall great valur for money,5
Great products using this from last one week.The battery life is awesome plus it charges full within 40 minutes.Bass is lower compared to another headsets in this price range but connectivity is great since I'm using with my Oneplus 6T you just have to stick the earphones together it pauses and gets disconnected with the phone and if you make them apart then they again connected. It saves the battery consumption.Really impressed with the build quality as well.Best headsets at this price r...,5
"First of all I received the product amidst this lockdown and Flipkart delivered even though one day later than the proposed day. Its fine against all of these odds and I needed these so much. Coming to the headset, the product is very sleek and classy, looks good, well manufactured.

But was disappointed with the bass, even though I have ...",3
"One of the best Bluetooth headset I have ever used. In the past I have used few other brands like Boult,leaf, Boat but none of them can Match the quick connection of this One Plus wireless z earphones and the best part is it just takes 24 mins to charge I can take shower and it's all charged up. One Plus is one of the best brands ever",5
"Again with an amazing product from none other than OnePlus. The main concern of Indian users is Bass and let me tell you it's too good. Not to extreme. Sound is balanced with good treble, bass and also the vocals oh my god, the vocals are amazing. So beautiful when you hear Classical music. Takes your soul to another place. I can't compare it as this is my second neckband, fat better than my previous one the Noise Sports. OnePlus Wireless Z has the best battery life for a neckband. Only 10 mi...",5
Just go for it decent bass But sound is crystal clear and its best if u like loud music Best sound quality and ofc the battery like😍😍,5
A great bluetooth earphone in it's price range. The bass is not that great but the overall sound quality is good. Neck band and the build quality is also nice. Battery backup is excellent. Charge for 10 min and you are good to go for a day. Great deal for earphones under Rs2000.,4
"This is absolutely unbeatable in terms of battery.Well there has been few days of using it but it's call quality, balanced music is perfect for me.For extra ordinary bass , go with higher ones.Noise cancellation works.",5
It's better than skull candy and the built quality is similar to the beatsX(apple).bass is pretty good. U are a bass lover use big size eartips so the bass quality will improve,5
It's really fantastic 😊 product but sound quality less but product is too good Thanks flipkart good product& fast delivery,5
"Very good pair of headphones. Can connect with at least 2 devices and can switch between these devices using the function key. Please note, you will be able to pair with the second device, only when it is not connected to the first paired device. so switch the bluetooth off on that device and then pair with the second device. I took some time to figure this out. on the second device the headset won't appear on the list while doing bluetooth scanning.bass is not on the best side, but overall ...",4
Product is awesome .....but bass is not so punche so who wants bass this product not good for those people's .....but sound quality is awesome and also battery backup is mind-blowing,5
I received the delivery in 7 days. This was first time I received so late even though I have Flipkart Plus. But very happy with the product. I own OnePlus 7T and as it says smart pairing with OnePlus devices it works great. Build quality is also very good and Bluetooth range is stunning. I can roam whole house without my phone still can hear the audio. But the sound somewhere I felt is lacking. I'm more of a music loving person and my choices may be bit different. It have very little bass and...,5
"Design and build is  pretty good, The neckband is of good quality but the wire coming from the neckband to earpiece should have been of better quality. The buttons are not so tactile and sometimes you will not notice the placement of buttons. The sound quality is good with medium bass but is not comparable to tha clarity and instrument separation provided by sennheiser. Battery life is exceptionally great. The device switching feature is of great use especially when you are working on a lapto...",5
"It has very balanced sound and very comfortable fit than my previous bullets wireless one.Happy with it.Review will be updated in future☺️. Bass is good enough,so don't be misguided.My honest review only in 1hr of using😄🤣",5
Best wireless headphones for oneplus Mobiles it supports warp charging 10 mins and battery life really awesome 20 hrs Sound clarity is good its supports Dolby sounds for oneplus 7t mobile.Under 2k it is one of the best headphone,5
"Not bad.... Compared to realme buds wireless which has slightly higher volume in exchange OnePlus bullets wireless z has better bass and sub-bass and since it supports Aac codec treble is also pretty clear. Build quality is slightly lower but volume button placement makes it better. Also it's pretty flexible so we can shove it in our pockets if we want, pretty convenient. And finally battery which is the biggest plus for this product it's the best I've seen so far in this price range",4
It a very comfortable product and easy to use as well. Sound is also decent..would have loved a bit more bass but overall satisfied with product. Battery backup is excellent.,4
"No more 2nd thought for this great earphones,best in class with balanced sounds,superb battery backup,it's far Better than OnePlus bullet wireless 1, blindly anyone can go for it.... thanks to Flipkart guy's for smooth dilivery and in time also.",5
Use equalizer to increase bass for this headset. Rest it offers best in class features. Excellent connectivity. Fast connection switching between 2 devices. And many others. Best buy at this price range.,4

Over all build quality is good... In 10 min you will get 10 hours of battery backup only if charged with dash charger... Bass is quite low... People who like bass go for real me beads which is cheaper but sound quality is slightly better.... Special feature it can switch between two devices just with one click that's e unique... You needn't to disconnect and connect manually,4

"It’s a ultimate and best 1 than the others available in the market. I’l just tel wt can be added to make it better1. The inbuilt mic and controlling buttons can be provided in the U shaped neck band itself than seperate.2. The length of the wire is bit long 3. I’m using it wit iphoneX, if I PAUSE the audio or video using the controller button in headset, i couldn’t able to RESUME it back by pressing the same button😔. I hv to RESUME it through my phone itself",4
Perfect for daily utility calls and music.Battery backup best in range and type c charge for faster charge.Music quality best in range.No doubt about build quality of one plus.Very happy with purchase 👍,5
The best wireless earphones for the price. Feature rich and balanced sound signature. Works even better if you have an oneplus phone.,5
Good quality product with best battery life good design ; good sound quality if the bass is something more this will be the best in 2000,5

"Oneplus bullets wireless z bluetooth headphones is awesome best sounds quality, easy to contactvity in this price segments best bluetooth headphones not compare any product at in this price segments.",5
"Really good it's awesome and sound quality it's awesome, I love it 😊😊😊😊♥️♥️♥️oneplus great job",5

"This earphones are absolutely stunner from OnePlus , loved it . The build quality is little bit on dull side, but the sound and mic quality are really awesome.. One best part about the earphones are although they don't come with noise cancellation but the buds fit so well in the ear that you can't even get a single noise from outside... The neckband is also smooth rubber . The best part is its battery which is really appreciable 👌👌. Thanks OnePlus and Flipkart team 😊",5
Beautiful design very flexible and comfortable .. good battery back Up. Sound is awesome ... Bass is not that high but vocals are very good. Value of money,5
supper built quality  but bass is not at all good  poor bassat high volume the clarity of music is not goodoverall its nice but i suggest samsum level u  if u r a one plus user then z is good,5
"If you are a just music lover then go for it .It is  perfect for workouts as it has IP55  protection against sweat.10 min =10 hours ,only applicable if you have a 30w wrap charger by OnePlus",3
One of the best Bluetooth headset. Sound clarity & battery bBackup is awesome. Connectivity range is also good. For me this is the master piece in this price range,5
"After a long wait, I finally got my hands on these new sets!And the first impression was amusing.I've been using these for two weeks now and hence writing down my observations with these phones. 1. Design - Have Always loved the light weight band ( I used to have OP Bullets Wireless 1 before ) . Feels light on the neck. Earbuds slip right in and do not slip out while working out.2. Sound - As compared to OP Wireless 1, the sound quality is a bit of a compromise. The audio is great for ...",4
"Balanced sound and very good sound clarity.... best thing is it’s battery backup up ... comparable design.... bass and vocals are well balanced live music experience but not for extreme bass lover( enough bass is their) over all worth to buy...compered to all other Bluetooth product, I am reviewing after 7days usage and sound quality is assom....",5
Overall product is Awesome 👌 but delivery is very very late this can take 6 Days of delivery and flipkart need to improve our delivery facility and i am happy😀 with this Earphones... Highly Recommend,5
"In one word this is an awesome neckband earphone. Everything is perfect and well balanced. Sound clarity, Bass, connectivity, features, battery everything is fantastic. Only thing is the wire coming out from the neckband should have been of better quality. It's like ordinary earphone. Realme Buds wireless is a pioneer in this. Except this it's superb.",5
"Product was excellent! Thank you flipkart for delivering within 2 days in these days. The battery backup was top , I think it simply last for a week even you are heavy user. Sound quality is excellent little bit of reduction in bass if you are a bass lover choose any other, for me it's an excellent choice. Build quality was also awesome, magnetic turn on/off was excellent. The connectivity is of premium, you can easily switch between devices within a second. Overall it's was an excellent...",5

"Perfect Bluetooth headset if you are not a Bass head.Awsome Battery, Call quality, Bluetooth range and overall good build quality. Fast charging is another good thing about this.Bass is present however don't expect heavy bass.If you want good bass and want to use mostly for music you can go for Realme wireless buds, but I would then suggest to wait if possible for the leaked Realme wireless buds pro, though there is no confirmation on when it will released.",4
Great product. Wrap charging is a step up for OP users. Decent sound quality at this price point. Build is solid . You can go for it,5

"Took almost a week to get their delivery in Chandigarh here. But otherwise, great earphones with perfectly balanced sound. Equally as good as wired earphones in this price range and some even higher. Low latency mode works perfectly with no lag in PUBG or anything. Battery backup is solid too. Been using it for the past three hours and the battery has only dropped to 80% from around 95% yet.I don't think you can go wrong with these, considering the plethora of rad features it offers along wi...",5

Awesome product by 1+ as I already love to this brand but it's really a good quality product made by one plus. In this price everyone should buy bullets Z.,5

Sound quality- It gives a crystal clear sound with good hugs and mids. Though the company claim that it gives a thumping bass but is not true because it's bass is quite average.Worth for money-: these earphones are worth for money in this price segment of 2000 rupees. Build quality-: the build quality is prenium and it is very comfortable when you are going for a walk or for running.Some important points you need to know about which the company claims:-Warp charge-  The warp charge in...,5

Such a worthy device from OnePlus. Great for music lovers. Perfectly fits into my ear. Worth every single penny. I'll strongly recommend this to everyone. Edit: Most of the users complain about the bass quality. I'll suggest everyone to use the large sized ear buds been provided in the box. Then feel the bass and thank me later.,5
Well balanced bass u don't regret after buying this. Build quality top notch and also battery backup is excellent.Just go for it. Best result in enjoying music or watching movies you don't feel any late sound effects but while playing pubg just noticeable difference only.,5

I'm using OnePlus7t so I have warp charger . I suggest this product for OnePlus users  because without warp charger 10 minutes features doesn't work and without Fnatic mode no low latency ( for PUBG ) .Fnatic mode available only in OnePlus devices. I'm fully satisfied about the quality.  If you have OnePlus phone must buy this value for money headset.,5

Very bed quality product. Voice is broken during calling and battery charging is not working now. i purchased it before 15 days but now facing so many problems Customer care told me there is no default in one plus bullets wireless bluetooth headset. I m very dissatisfied with this bluetooth headset.,1

Nice headphone battery backup 7day on fully charged,5
Very Disappointed  with the product.  Mike is not working after 6 days like local Chinese products. Ohh forgot this is also a Chinese products but having some popularity. So boycott  Chinese  product  and become ATMANIRBHAR😊😊,5
"Those who are complaing about low bass... it's a humble request to you all please change the ear tips to a larger size and try to listen. Intially i was also not happy with the bass,but after changing ear tips omg class bass. Just awesome.",5
"If you want to compare bass to other like I have boat 255 then you will definitely disappoint.So don't check comparison, bass is ok not too loud great battery backup. And great range.But  noise cancellation poor, it feel when you call someone in openspace.",4
A very high quality product nvr ever seen. Nice sounds with very smooth product. Thanks to OP .,5

Mic is not working  flipcart team is not responding properly,1
Bluetooth connectivity issues,1
This product is too much  good. It's really osam product,5
Before I’ve had one plus wireless 2......these are definitely better than those.......except the high pitches will pinch ur ear........and the device switch doesn’t work properly.......everything else is perfectly f9,5
"After using 7 hours battery % is 100,Sounding is good,Build Quality is good,Quick connect, low latency, magnetic controlls,Everything is good.-consNo noise cancellation,No bass at all.In this budget, it is a terrific  product.",4
This is the one of the best wireless product in this price range.... Battery of this wireless is awesome..10 min charge 10 hours battery life..I am going to cut  one star because of box...I found the box without Never settle logo..I am still confused ...why I found this box without OnePlus never settle logo? Is anyone found the same issue..,4
Thank you flipkart,5
"So to the people who are saying that the bass is low, you guys are mistaken. Even though it shows that you are on the maximum voice limit on your phone just click the '+' button on your headset till you hear a beep sound. Trust me, the bass is at its very best.No more misguiding. First I also thought the same but when I got the product only I get to know more about it.",5
Awsome Bluetooth Nice Design 😇😅,5
Many people bad comments about its base but this is enough for a human.🤣🤣🤣,5
Within 20 days volume control and mic buttons has stopped working...,1
Pros:Greater sound clarity.Perfect fit.Excellent battery backup.No sound laging.Good built quality.Suitable for long time use.Great built quality.Cons.:Bass is less when compared to others on this price range.Overall excellent product for 2k. Not recommended for bass lovers,5
Everything is good but charging port does not have cover.,4
"Overall the sound is clear and high lows are clear too. Bas lacs a bit, but it is decent. The built quality and the battery life are really really good. Latency is good for playing pubg or watching videos.",5
"Bass is ""perfectly fine"".If samsung galxy buds has 10/10 bass (Rs. 10000)This monster has 4/10 bass ( Rs. 2000)There are many youtubers says it has low bass, in many reviews you can see some says it has low bass, they all are high quality, high price earphones user, if you are not then you definitely love it.And i assure you, you'll not regret buying it,What more you want in 2000, the battery backup,The built quality, the sound quality, and even the bass, all it has.",5
Wao...😀😀,5

Much awaited variant....i just wait for 4months for this mint variant.. really happy after buying this,5
"Over all product is good in build quality ,sound quality but there is a lag while  playing games. Battery backup is also awesome.. OnePlus devices only get low latency. For playing media and calls it's a good option",5
I am writing this review after using it for 15 days. Overall build quality is nice. It's flexible and can be easily folded. What I really liked is its battery backup. On charging once I was getting 15+ hours backup which is I think best in class. What I feel disappointed about is its sound quality its sound is pretty much bland everything is balanced. I was using Sony's earphones earlier I feel it's a significant downgrade in terms of sound. Also I am getting disturbance during calls but no o...,3
Plz do not go with the negatives reviews.I was a bit hesistant before buying it bcz reviews said bass is not good.But i must bass is not at all that bad.I will not say its  excillent but it is pretty much good.The battery back up is just awesome.No other earphone can challenge the battery backup.Built quality is also excellent.Pairing is also not a issue.I must say it is completely worth the price.,5
Sound quality is very good battery backup was excellentTry to improve the bassI never got the never settled tag line in boxI thought it was fake product but the OnePlus company has said that the stopped the tag line in the upcoming manufacturing products,4
"If you planned to buy this One+ Wireless Bullets Z, then please read the description Carefully. They don't mention ""Active Noise Cancellation"" in anywhere. This earphone got many cool features but when it comes to sound quality it's worst simply worst, when you drive your bike/sitting in front on cooler and talking to to someone on call using this bluetooth device than the person on the other side face the real  difficulty to talk with you. And its so annoying when someone told you repeatedly...",1
Perfect combination...🍎1+.. 😍 sound quality awesome except bass,5
I have been using this for two months. Here is my reviewPlus points:Battery back up is biggest asset of this headsetBuild quality is goodMinus points:Bass is very very lessSound quality is average. Not upto 1plus standard,3
Awesome 👌👌👌👌👌,5
"Great headset from one plus,super sound quality,nice built,super battery backup,from the comments i thought bass will be too low,but after hearing i didnt feel like bass is low...super product from oneplus.great experience.",5
"Super product.Oneplus really did the best job in this segmentBass is quite superb.The only major issue is the loudness of product, it's not up to that which other brands provide.",5
No one can beat these just out of competition,5
Extreamly gooooddd. Gr8 audio. And battery  life is terrific.  U don't hv to charge  it for a week,5
Sound quality is not up to par with other wireless earphones in this range. But battery backup and build is really good for the price and that makes the whole difference for me. I travel a lot and this is my primary earphones and that means the 20 hour battery is a very big advantage. Also I use this to take calls majority of time so sound quality doesn't matter.If you are primary using it for watching movies or listening music or bass heavy stuff don't go for it. Go for oppo enco m31 inste...,5

Right side stopped working in just a month...Horrible build quality from OnePlus....and only one service centre now in Hyderabad..Pathetic,1
Not worth..Bass is poor.. sound pinches in earsGo for boat earphone at lower price.. One plus is making fool on brand's name..,4
1 Star Less for Low Latency Scam on my OnePlus 5. Low latency works only when on phone call while playing Games. Other devices may have got Updates for this but not my Oneplus 5 which they included for Low Latency. Another  Star less for Bass.  Cannot feel bass whatsoever. It has many Pros Including:-Loudness - Very loud and clear than other earphone. Features- Magnetic Control and Other Functions are the best. Batter Charging and Backup- Charging very very fast.,3
Bass is excellent. Sound quality is good considering its affordable price.,4
Awesome music qualityDecent bassNo latencySeparating the magnets - turns onJoining the magnets - turns offAwesome build qualityGo for the BLUE onesMust Buy!,5
Received a day ahead n nicely delivered by Flipkart. Built quality is good n matches the price. Let me test for couple of days to write a detailed review.,5

Great sound quality... bass is little bit low,5
OnePlus Bluetooth is really fantastic  it's my opinion  those who wants a pleasant sound  specially music lovers plz go for it. Without any doubt,5
"Top notch Build Quality. Excellent Battery backup supported by Warp Charge. Essential for a Bluetooth Headset. Sound is loud,Vocals are clear. One drawback i found is Bass is comparitively less. They should have packed atleast 11mm driver. Anyway it's good value for money. A must have for oneplus Mobile users especially for those who have warp charger. Pairing is easy. And turning on and off the headset is simple ,just separate ear plugs and vice-versa to on and off. Magnetic mechanism is cool.",5
Nice product am satisfied          Normal bass     Sound quality goodBattery backup excellent        Overall 8.5/10,5

Outstanding  performance ..good sound quality especially in calling and good range and battery life too...I saw that many people were confused about low bass ..but I think oneplus provides a decent bass and if you want your bass boosted you can go for apps in playstore,4
The mic is pathetic. The bass is 0,1
Worst product..sound quality like china 10 rupees earphone.Totally disappointed oneplus,1

Good designGood soundGood qualityAll 10/10,4
Wounderful for online class and it is also good for listening song and youtube video,5
in terms of battery.....awesomeotherwise average,4
Initially battery was fabulous.....but after using for 2 months battery back up not upto the mark..... though it is better than headphones...but as the main reason to buy it for battery back up it disappointed after 2 months of usage     ....... typical Chinese product,5
Nice build qualityGreat sound Excellent battery backupCharges within an hour with 15 watt charger,4
"Awesome build quality.Awesome battery backupVery good for daily usage.Wrap charge (10 Min 10 Hrs Music) really works.Go for it without any second opinion. Anyways, I've got it for 1799/- (Blue) on a sale.Thank you OnePlus for bringing this to India.Thank you flipkart.",5

Overall good productBut bass is less Ultimate battery backup,4
Sound quality and design  is not gud.. but battery backup is osammmmm,2
Awesome headset... But flipkart is taking too much time to deliver this product to me.,5
One of the best Wireless headphones from Oneplus.I have been using since 2 months ago it's really a nice product.,5
The best one in this price. Mic and sound quality both are awesome.,5

don't buy this earphone bought 2 months before mic is not working,1
m writing it after using it extensively for a month..the sound is awsm..and the vocals and trebles r good...bass is also nyc....but it doesn't hv a extra thumping bass..if u r looking 4 it...u should go for realme wireless ....otherwise go 4 itthe battery backup ..and fast charging is the best....the build quality is good..,4
"Got this on 6th August. On 8th August, not responding and connecting to phone. Continuously showing white led without blink. And saw many people having same issue and had to replace or wait 3-4 day for discharging l. Certainly not a good experience. I am OnePlus user having 5T and have no problem at all. But now OP are releasing cheap product. So be thoughtful before buying these.",3
Sound quality is very bad quality,1
"Some one is created bad impression about bass, really awesome sound, great build quality, massive battery back up. Believe me & blindly buy if you are having thoughts to buy new neckband headset.",5
"It is a premium product, the battery is unbeatable! but I sometimes face trouble while shifting from one device to others and it gets annoying. the mic is bad many times people I talked to complained about the low voice and bass I feel is below average. overall I am happy, this product is built to last!",3
"Battery lasts longer, Bluetooth connection works fine, Gets full charged in an hour, No pain in ear, design is good, Magnetic on/off works excellent.Overall Go with the product, worth buying.",5
Works well but you have to pick phone using mobile device. There is no option to receive or pick call using headset.,3
Very nice products love you one plus,5
Very good headphone.,5
Good earphones. Low latency mode at this price is good. Battery backup is excellent. Build quality is not the best. But u get more than enough at this price. And as always Flipkart delivered fast in this lockdown.,4
"You could listen crystal clear audio with highs and lows, mids, vocals, treble everything with decent bass. The battery backup is astonishing, the build quality is very rigid. You shouldn't regret about the product. Worth every penny.",5
Don't worry about missing logo . Product is amazing and original 👌😍. Company changed the box design .,5
If you are not a mad bass lover then go for it.it has the best battery backup and microphone.But it has one drawback that is if you pull the wire very tightly then it has a chance of breaking because I think it's wire is of a little bit poor quality.otherwise it is the best bluetooth headphone ever.I am using it for atleast 3 months and nothing has happened with it still now,5
😍gud one go for it,5
ADVANTAGE - Yes it is an best product and while using with low sound I can't here outside sound it means that this is noise cancellation. INSTRUCTIONS - You will buy this product pls read instructions carefully like I will give u an example-: Do not use this earphone over 1hr time duration is given for the safty if your ear and Do not use earphones during thunderstorm.DISADVANTAGE - One problem I have seen that while Texting the tap sound comes very late if you will ask How much rating you ...,4

Maybe after some time when I will use many time it becomes habit. ..** Finally Product is Very Good .*****Suggestions*******Some beep or Vibration or Both ,fu...",5
"The bass is higher when volume buttons press continuously. Battery backup is very good. When I got, it was fully 100% charged. So it's good product",5
Noise cancellation is not good... It's not hears good for opposite persons while talking otherwise it's best one,4
"Thank you Flipkart ✌️..Just ignore all the negative commentsIt's Osm product with pretty sound 🎶Yes it hasn't unnecessary bass which is not require for ur comfort, actually it's classic 😇👌just go for it🚴.",5
"Charges fast ,long battery backup and best quality sound what else you need..?",5
Excellent product,4
Awesome sound quality,5
Light and perfect for my oneplus 8 🔥 You can play pubg with no sound delay 👍,5

"The pack was not having NEVER SETTLE sign in it, bt product seems original.. it is good in sound for normal, decent users.. who wants to hear music can hear and who wants to blow their ears can look for something else..",5

"Mic catching power very low, only sound quality say to good",1
To be honest Very low sound,2
Mic is not working properly,3
Battery backup is awesome. Sound quality is also good. Not for base lover. Sound is as same as boat wired earphone of Rs. 700. I have not much knowledge about bass and music. But as common it's just a beast for me,5
Worst product Having issue while calling the person other side able hear noise of background more than my voice,5
oneplus brand only for mobiles..for music plz go for boat or sony n others,3
"Good product. Nc sound. Exlent, osm and wow charge",5
"Battery backups  is really good, Sounds  is good, Bass not Bad,Rang  is really  good Bt if u want  to play  games  with it,U can't, Sounds  is delay then the action, Some time  it happens  in playing  YouTube also,",4
"Boat bluebooth ear phones are far better than this one. After two months usage, it is disconnecting automatically and also sometimes audio sender not working properly.The receivers are unable to hear me or they saying my voice is not clear.",2

I don't see 20 hours battery life but if I charge it once my complete day goes very well. As I have a lot of meetings so I need with good battery life. I guess it's approx 10-14 hours max.Rest it's ok with the functionality. Happy with it,3
Mic not working properly and also replacing option is not possible.,1
Super Quality,3
the mic stopped working in a month and neither flipkart nor one plus helping .. worst experience,1
Excellent,5
If you want to feel the real music just go for it. Awesome sound quality. And battery backup is superb. Previously I was using boat rockers blutooth but that's average product. But this one is mind-blowing.,5
Highs and mids are really great.. But lows are lacking.. And bass is below Avg... Connectivity is gd.. Gd features.. 3.7/5,3
Bass is good........better than my Sennheiser cx180 earphonesI don't know why most of the people are comparing this with realme buds wireless....guys trust me one of my cousin have the same realme bluetooth headphones I listened to some music but I'm totally disappointed with realmeYou'll get irritated on full volume.Oneplus gives me a decent battery backup of 15-16 hrs.I usually compare every headphones with my Sennheiser cx180 and I must say oneplus is better than cx180.,5
"The connectivity is superb.Calls are clearly audible on both sides (caller & reciever).The bass is a bit less, but it's ok.There is no noise cancellation.Hats off to the battery backup (lasts upto 20-22 hours).Best thing is it's dual pairing.",4
Super product,5
Very bad items,1
Best of prices,5
Sound quality is damn low,5
"I have purchased this earphones one month back and now facing an issue with the device that it get hang and white light is continously on and the device is not responding at all. Many people are facing the same issue, I have seen those peoples comments on OP community. One guy tried a solution that he let the battery drained completely and then charged it and it started working. I am trying the same solution let it works or not for me.  I would not recommend to buy this product.",3
Best products in this price Bluetooth quality is best but your delivery system is very poor and your delivery boy is also rude in behaviour it was quite obvious if i m. Waiting for yours products from expected date is over then don't your delivery boy wait for 5min. More next time it will not happen again just remind it..,4
"I am reviewing after 1 month of usage. Battery backup is amazing. The design and build quality is super. The sound quality is also good. While calls, there is no background noise compared to others. The only problem I felt that when the side with control switch and mic is covered (especially while laying on bed) the sound gets broken. But it is ok in other cases. Overall the product is awesome.",5
Over all good from all aspects n better for playing PUBG almost no time lag of gaming sound as promised 🤟🏼🙌🏼,5

Quality is way better but sound quality could have been better.,5
"Was a bit skeptical about buying this and had lot of confusion between this and realme wireless, but after using it I could say that this one is very good in short very low latency while gaming or watching videos, clear sound(bass is to the mark not very high, not very low), you can switch between two device with a switch",5
Significant sound quality. Affordable in mid price,5
"Now I got a first ecosystem from OnePlus..I used realme bids air,when I'm going to jogging I have to reset and connect it to my watch which is really annoying.. but in this OnePlus wireless Z, I just have to double press the button then I can easily switch from mobile to watch and watch to mobile. Battery life is awesome. I don't really like bass so I use only 50% of volume to play. So I can get more than 4 day battery life. The charging nothing need to talk about it with my OnePlus 7 pro's d...",5
Outstanding product.Best in wireless earphones.,5
Good quality,4
"I tried Mivi, then Boult and then finally tried to double up my budget to buy this. I can say it is worth specially with One plus Device.One feature that I loved is re-connecting time. The moment you paste it with magnet it turns off but aa you add them into your ear, it will be found connected - That's the speed I wanted !",5
Velue for money,5
They are fine..no regrets..,5
Good product.Good build quality. OnePlus should launch all its products on flipkart.,5

If you don't have AAC SUPPORTED phone don't buy. SBC quality is not good with this earphones. Price is higher overall. Quality is good. Battery backup is good but not 10hrs in 10 min charging and 20hrs in 30in charging. Charge 100%in 30 minutes. Sometimes create problem in connection. But not frequently. Overall price range should be 1500 not 2000. Wire should be breaded in this range. Easy to use.,3
If you are a OnePlus user definitely and must buy it...or rather you guys are not in the track of getting quality...,5
"Best product till i hav ever seeen,",5

Talking about battery backup and connectivity I have no issues. But after  10 days there's some problem while watching videos on YouTube or playing pubg what happens is the audio doesn't synchronise with the video. Sometimes even it happens when using instagram. Microphone is not that great too.,2

Just lacks a little bass otherwise it's an excellent purchase.,4
"The best wireless earphone, n battery backup just awesome even design also nice",5
"Well, they're okay for the most part where you'd want more usability and features than the sound quality. They definitely lack a punch and can sound real harsh at times. Sound quality more like a Rs.500 headphones but where it stands out is the overall hassle free usage, charging and quick switch (works like a charm). I use it mostly for podcasts and phone calls, they solve the purpose just fine and then some.If you're looking for a pair that delivers some punch, spend a little more and ...",4
Excellent bass 5/5 love it you must buy this,5
NICE,5
Nice product,5
Excellent earphones except for the bass,5
Better than other according to price and sound quality . Battery backup is also good.,5
Low Latency mode is a gimmick. Pubg sound is lagging very much on my One plus 5 with fnatic mode....,4
Battery backup is good bt 100% se direct 80% then after 30% hi jati hai bt after all this is good product,4
Not good for Pubg,1

Very good earphones at 1999,5
1 sec Delay in sound while playing PUBG. Not comfortable for more then 1-2 hours continuous use.,2
Pros: Battery: Sound: Build quality: Convience switch: Looks: Light weight: Easy to carry: Water/sweat resistantCons: No pouch for safetyI bought it for INR 999 only so for me it was a steel deal.,5

Nice head set good fit nice quality good to handily poli aytem anu magnet pora kolllam migacha aytem,5
The build quality is really good and the design also looks great. The magnets of earbuds are also really useful. The best part is the cable organizer which is really useful. The bass is good and the sound quality is also good you will not be disappointed buying this product at this price. The call quality is also good and the placement of buttons is very functional and useful. Buy without any doubt.,5

What a immersive experience on the headphones...when i listen music on them it feels like i'm sitting in any live show... best sound quality i've ever experienced on this price range.  superb realme it wroth the price.. Its looks are also cool to see with yellow lines. The button of the remote are tactile and easy to use and differentiate. The sound goes to extreme volume no trouble after long hours of use.,5
"It's a interesting product so I'm writing this after 24 hours of burn out.. so stay tuned to know the full story.. eartips are silicone tips very comfortable but doesn't stay in my ear much well, but your mileage may vary.. build is great but after receiving my item I noticed scuffs and nylons coming off a little from the part near 3.5 mm port.. otherwise it's built really well.. speakers for calls is tremendous easily putting mi basics to shame.. it's great for people like me who talks a lot...",5

"seriously abnormal bass guys...which is a big. negative about this earpiece ... ..i dont know why nobody paid attention to this bass boost feature , which is  annoying. ...you will never be able to listen to the originally recorded song ....but  will  hear  abnormal extreme bass in every song you play ..which may not be pleasing ....and you want to turn off the feature ...but you can not  coz it is a default  feature in this earpiece...sound clarity is good ..build also good .......but i wil...",2
"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe.",3

sound is good i mean it have very loud sound. but speaking about bass im not too happy with it because bass is soo powerful but not soo clear as jbl have,1
"It's a allrounder. I used this for playing pubg , footsteps is clearly audible, music is awesome . I suggest you to purchase this earphone if your budget is under 600. I am happy with the product.",5
Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play. I previously used Mi basic after 1 year one side went not working. This one has better bass and sound clarity than Mi basic headset. Go for it guys,5
"sound quality+bass is quiet good , tangled free , and the design is great too , i give it a full 5 stars★★★★★",5
It's a great product according to the price and its sound quality and bass is perfect.Realme Buds 2 really its a great headphone.In this price range best headphone ever.❤️,5

The best value for money product and also the  build quality is good and lite wait and I also like that yellow strip it's very useful,4

I am happy good quality  product. Nice bass and sound clarity,5
Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.,5
It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.Hope realme buds 3 will co...,5
Boat basshead 220 have better bass than buds2. But vocal of buds2 is better than boat 220...  It produces very clear sound 🔊 loved 😍 by music lover... Must buy but warranty must 1 year 😔,3
"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily. Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.v.",5
Sound quality is amazing and build quantity is also amazing my brother is also using this ear buds 1 for long time and its performance is still very good so I also ordered ear buds 2 and both are amazing and working up to expectations.,5
The Sound quality is superb and the base quality is also good ..The point thing which I liked in this earphone is that its durability ..the wire quality is good ..before I was using the sennheiser cx275 ..the wire got cut from middle ..I am happy with this earphones.,5
NICE PRODUCT... WORTH BUYING.....!!!!Its a Signature sound by Realme India..I love the sound... Best in Segment.@REALME INDIA.,5

"I am using this headphones from last 6 month , sound quality superb , bass is less in comparison of my brother's boat basshead 225 , but bass is good , built quality very good , magnit is a pros , valuable price , wire quality osm , and this is one of the  best headphones that I uses . 2nd is boat 225 ☺️☺️ must buy",5
Good bass over all nice i get Rs599 MRP price is 699 if you are getting under 500 then best,4
"This is the best for daily use. It feels like nothing when in the ear and it's easy to keep organised, thanks to the magnets and organizer. It also has two extra buds one small and large which you can use according to your preference. It also has a tangle free wire. And Flipkart packing and delivery is always the best. No doubt about that.",5
Sound quality is acceptable with price range.bass quality is super . Design and build quality is good but personally i Don't like tha wair .all thing is good is this price segment but i have some issue with this mic and the bottoms .,4
"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one.",3
Best earphone under this price range i have bought sony buds which was available Rs100 more than this price but its sound was low in compare to realme buds2 best earphone under this price range with boosted bass bass is best,5
"It's sound is osum and bass too , earphone material also very good and trust me guys I am writing this review after 7 month and it is perfect for you so buy this earphone",5
"Sounds gets zzz....  after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound   but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one.",4
"Its a nice product. I ordered orange colour and over all sound, build and extra bass also very good.Sound and call Control system very useful(single, double, triple and long button pressing).Before I used boAt 220 and its a different experience.For 599 rupees its a worthy product compare to Sennheiser and JBL.

Few things I would like be get added...",4
Wow . I mean i am speechless. Because it's an wonderful earphones. I play better PUBG with this earphone. East or west FLIPKART is best. I suggest my friends group and everyone to buy it earphone.,5
"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months.",2
"O yes, I have got it.Guys, this is the best designed, wonderful sound quality earphone under the price of 600.Do not think about it, just trust realme. It will not hurt you.Thank you realme for giving me this amazing earphone.",5
The connectivity of the jack is very bad sometimes it works fine but mostly u have to unplug and replugg it again when it's not working.I have checked it with other hedphones it works fine so it's not a issue with my phone's 3.5mm jack its the headphone plug.REALME please look in this and get it fixed,1
This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered. Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt...,4

"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov...",4

really I'm saying this headset is pretty good and the bill quality is awesome and there is some more good bass sound effect but there is no L shaped 3.5mm jack,4
The sound quality and the build quality of this product is amazing for the price. The bass and the treble is clear. The bass is enhanced but is not way too heavy for head pain. The sound is clear and crisp for the price. No complaints.,5
"build is very nice but the sound quality is not so great.Though the bass is high but the sound treble, mids and low are very poor. Overall sound vocal are not clear and fell like only base is boosted.the connection jack is also not L shaped, it is straight so if you have jack hole at bottom of your phone then it's a big trouble.",3

Disclaimer - You cannot return this order so be careful. Coming to review - dont know why so much hype is created for this earphone like its the best This earphone is bu*#%&*it.Has bass but doesnt feel as bass just cheap drum sound feeling for bass nothing as u will be amazed for played songs on iphone 6s ! Sound clearity is missing Overall is what u expect to feel the music the emotion is missing they way sound should make u feel nirvana takes u to a particular zone is missing in short ...,5
"finally reviewing so many products, picked up the best one. thanks flipkart for timely delivery. the earphone is really great but the vocals are not upto the mark. this earphone's are not to hear songs like lucky ali, arijit singh's and others which includes vocals.",4
If you are a bass love go for it but if you like to hear pure music with decent bass you can go for other if you have high budget but it is specially for bass lover for me,5

1) Loved the design. 2) Pretty good cable ( I am a very rough user so most of the headphones don't last longer than 3 weeks but this one will probably last for 6 months )3) Sound quality is decent for this price point ( Though Bass is a bit low )4) My iPad's headphone socket had some issues and all other headphones I had would just come out if it if you accidentally touched the jack but this one fits perfectly and no such issues.,5

Best Earphones under 700Rs1- Good Quality sound like Sony.2- Good quality Bass and build quality is also excellent. 3- Must Buy if your budget is under 1000rs4- Microphone is also good.,5
"As simple as that, you will have good mids and treble and the highs sometimes are unpleasing but the overall sound is fine and balanced. But the bass could have been more deep and that would have made these earphones perfect",4
Build quality is ok not up to the mark but satisfying in 500 rupees. treble is good but bass is not that much. buttons for volume up down and call receive are very responsive,4

I might have heard that song more than 50 times.",5
This is a very good product.The sound quality and bass from it is soo close to the one from my old Skullcandy Ink'd headphones. A must buy under 600k range.The build quality and the finish as also top notch. Great job realme!And thanks to flipkart for that speedy delivery.,5

It's very nice headset I love music and realme headset is good work in realme phone  very good headset thank you filpkart,3
It is an sexy product in this rate of price  But one should negatively show its last port which surface is smooth so if you have little oily hand you can’t take it so easy be careful.It is not gold plated it is another please correct it And design of it is straight Other wise it is Awesome bestseller in market,5
The quality of the earphone is very good it may comepete with the earphones which are about 1500 rs to 2000 rs the bass and treble are so nice but due to bass the vocals may affected a little but in your day to day usage you don't feel but those who are bass lovers like me the absolutely prefer this earphone Good luck,5
"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi  i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it  decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better",5
I love this realme earphones the quality the vocals are sooo amazing I am in love with realme buds 2 .the product in this price segment is super cool I think everyone should try this I am sure they love it.😍😍🤗🤗,5
It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming  but the Base is only experiencenced well  when the sound  is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.                                  🙏🤟,4
Super prodact 11.2mm bass nice sound (cheep and best quantity)and thanks for fleep cart safe Pack and fast belivary,4

After using it for two weeks i can surely say these earphones are fabulous at this price range 🔥..∆Pros:1) build quality is very good 😍..2) sound quality is decent and bass is superb💥3) magnetic ear tips which i don't know what is use of it as these are wired earphones🙄🙄 but yes this is an additional features😝..∆Cons:1)they should give L shape gold plated jack ☹️.. GO FOR IT🔥🔥 DON'T THINK TOO MUCH😍😍,5
Overall the product is best .Bass is really crispy and sounds with great qualityQuality is top of the notch ! Worth to buy,5
"Best earphone under 500 , sound is crunchy but bass is like 7 on 10. Overall best product from realme.",4
It's a very cool and funky kind of ear phones and looks pretty cool to put on.  It's magnetic effect makes it more stylish. Sound and Bass quality is good but it can be more better.And Thanks to the delivery person who delivered it while it was raining. Overall it's a good product.,4

"amazing quality ..best sound best build quality  loved it  must try this , bass is amazing everything is perfect",5
"Amazing Realme..best in sound quality, best in bass, best in built in..just superb.i am using Shennheiser cc 180, but after listening to these buds my choice changed to Realme.",5
posting this detailed review after 9 days of continuous use.pros:-a) build quality of these earphone are really obe of the best in the price bracket of under 1k. The braided cable really feels tough. The magnets and cable organizer is really a welcoming features of this earphones.b) sound quality of these earphone are really good especially after 1 hr of burn in( 1more assistant app) the sound clarity of the earphone improved a lot...u can clearly hear all the instruments and the vocals...,4
are you a melody lover this thing is abeast in that but moving to bass and treble its not better than boAt bassheads 220 in the same price range .....so make sure that its useful for your purposes..,5
"I got my earphones yesterday, it's sound quality is extremely good, that you cannot raise the volume even above 40, speaking about the bass it's better than boat 225 (as I've already used it). Especially the surrounding music gives you an amazing feel. speaking of the build quality the braided cables are good, but some people complaining that it's not having an L-shaped Jack, but for me it's not a problem as I've already used boat 225 earphones it has L-shaped Jack but it doesn't last so long...",5
This product is just awesome. The sound quality is best in this price range. The bass lovers are loved this very much because it  was proved. The design is also nice but I thought the volume switch buttons are slightly handle to touch....,5
Hey I buy this earbuds 3 days ago and as my experience this earbuds is superb and fantastic bass is awesome sound quality is amazing (spectacular) don't think so much and waste your time on other earphones buy this one . perfect time delivery . built quality is good wire quality good realme is very time best don't think so much just buy it value of money product tysm realme❤,5
It was amazing 👌 my honest opinion says it is very very much best earphone and in this price it is superb !!!,5
Very good product at this price segment... The built quality and Audio quality is awesome.... The bass booster does it work perfectly..... The earphone is made up of braided cable and it is tangle free easy to handle the earphone.,5
"Got these headset after going through many reviews as i had previously used Jbl,boat, 1more etc. The so i was confused to either buy some costly headset or go for a bit cheaper. These headset are pretty loud with very good bass, even listening to soft music you can feel that song. I fel that it has good amount of bass with some surround sound effect.... Using it from past 2 weeks.. Satisfied till date.",5
sound quality is crispy and clear.  base is good . the material of the wire is very good . finally I got a good headphone . if you want a durable headphone then go for it . if not boat rockers are also good option . but I prefer durable headphone which can long last like 3 years,5
best earphones I have ever buy in life soft and clear sound bass is little bit low but it doesn't effect the sound just fabulous,5
super super super very very good earphones best budget earphones thank you realme thank you Flipkart,5
"Earphone got best fit in the ear, comes with extra buds, wire is pretty flexible, made by good quality material. Sound quality can be compared with earphones like that of JBL and BOAT, 3.5mm jack makes it more comfortable to use and fit in almost all mobile jacks. Bass quality is descent. Good for playing games like PUBGMobile, etc. Honestly the best earphones at low price.",4
"yo! received the item today yo... using it n i can say its pretty dope yo.. u know what m sayn... feels like a high end earphones yeah.... worth buying it yo homies... now i can record my music like a pro yo... really appreciate it man... flipkart n realme yooooooooo....... don't look out for any other more reviews... i said it already n its done.. PERIOD YO!!!!! U KNOW WHAT M SAYN.... BASS, TREBLE AND EVERYTHING SOUNDS DOPE MAN... Peace out from STRAIGHT OUT OF NAGALAND YO...... \m/ \m/",5
Vocal-- not clear. Instrument separation --- not good. Loudness- highFor pubg that's good enough . But as a music lover this is the worst.,2
Realmi buds 2 very hard bass and sound quality much better. You feel high up music. It's compact size also good. It's 10-30% volume very slowly and 90-100 % sounds quality compromise not clear hearing people says . 30-80% volume very best for hearing music but every time you gets high and better bass. If audio jack are in shape of l types  connector than it much better.  It's a very good  earphones. I love this earphone .,4
I was thought this product is amazing sound quality that's why I ordered this product. what does sound quality is not really good it is every sound quality like 400₹ MI headphone.,2
"I've been using this past 6 months.I'd say in terms of durability it matches with any sport version of Sennheiser.Bass is high, this affects the balance.Treble is high at 100% volume. Should listen to music at max 80% volume.Surround sound is excellent for watching movies, since its realme buds the Dolby Atmos can be utilised to its full extent.If the bass was not kicked up a notch and more money was put into clarity this would have matched with the likes of JBL.",4
The sound quality is not much good because my brother also have Boat 220 and i have compared both side by side and i am surprised the Boat 220 have far better sound quality than Realme buds2...This is my genuine review,3
"Price worthy product.. Before i use boat bass boost,im not feel comfortable while wearing..because lot of weight in that especially they build with material,so it get irritated...In this earphone i feel more comfortable and highlight thing is yellow band that really useful for traveling.. Find i found a good product",5
"Not bad at all, but I can find something more than this at this price segment i.e., 599. realme can improve well in realme buds 2 as I'm a pure realme user.But in 18 months they progress like that I can't believe on it which is not by Oppo, OnePlus, Apple(iPhone), etc. I never negate Oppo, OnePlus and Apples progress but it's truly incredible by realme.I have lots of faith on realme that they do well more than today.As a real realme user I wish grow well you my artificial brother i.e., rea...",3
It is the best earphones you can get at this price range. Bass is superb and punchy. Vocals are pretty good. Cable quality is better than all earphones at this price point.I am using this with my Realme 6 pro and it is great. If your phone supports DOLBY audio then its a win-win.Also the cable organizer is really useful and handy.One downside is that it is plastic build but trust me it is a very good quality pastic and the construction is really sound.If it is plastic build it should ...,4
"First of all delivery was super super fast!!!got delivered my buds2 in just 2 hrs after ordering it!!!best sound quality,nice design,bass super good,colour may vary different as shown in picture but good!!!flipkart,realme both doing fantabulous job!!!love the buds 2 looks super cool",5
"Firstly, music is not soft unnecessarily loud but bass is good. Can be managed if heard at a drop. Secondly, no t shape or l shape jack and not gold plated. Thirdly. Voice is good. Noise isolation and cancellation availability Build great. Liking it at the first go. Will be able to tell better after 1 month use. The receiver could be a better one. Overall, can buy. A good buy.",3
"Expectations r more on focusing real bass but come to reality bass are not upto mark. The bass is similar to bass of samsung feature phones earphones. But surrounding effect, trepel and vocals are very clear also volume is very loud in full sound am not find any distortions. Design is good, quality of wire long lasting .Am using in MAXPROM1   CONS:* Bass is not upto mark.* its bass is 10% better than samsung feature phone earphones .Bass is 3.5/5* Performance is normal but cost is highpr...",4
"Hi Folks,Usually i recommended to buy product with good reviews. I listen about the quality of these earphones from my friends and do some random google search and bought the product.Reviews bases on after use of product-Sound Quality- I think this is good product from realme in this price range(500 is worthy, Not more than that). With same configuration you may baught Sennheiser cx180 in a little bit higher price approx 700-800Bass - i don't recommended too higher bass..but the quali...",4
Sound quality and design is superb. But i have to add something more important and considerable ::1. Best part of this earphone is wire coating. None of the other earphone give you this feature in such a price. I know it is not much matter but it keeps ur earphone safe.2. 2nd main part right placement of mic. Many other earphone miss this. This is necessary feature because you don't need to hold mic near ur mouth while in call.,5
The product of awesome in quality. The base is good and most important the earphone can be used roughly as the build quality is good.,4
Best in the league... Good bass.. best sound quality... Must buy ... Also best build quality,5
Its a pure one dont miss itVery attractive design and very comfortable More effective bass and sound qualityIts have braided wire thats help to survive long life to the headset please try this awesome headset from realme(thankyou flipkart)😍,5
"Hey , I know why you are here looking through reviews . I know what you want. These earphones are good for 599 , sound is pretty loud . bass on these is not that good . it is there you will feel the boom boom . but it will be sounding like coming from a cheap speaker . mids just sound so muffled . its not the best sounding earphones . as I can say cause if you ask me for earphones below 1500 . CX213 is my choice , best sounding earphones under 1500 only thing , it doesn't have mic and now I h...",3
"Really a nice experience with this earphone than the others, Built quality is just amazing, In this budget it the best earphone I prefer. Thank you.",5
Has good headset is also good in appearance sound quality is also good thanks realme and thank you so much flipkart,3
Great balanced headphones for the price. I prefer balanced headphones over bass heavy one's. The dialogues in movies and shows are audible and clear.,5
If you are a bass lover and wanna buy or searching a budget earbuds in a budget friendly deal with some great bass boost sounds experience + unique stylish finish + good wire quality then it will be a great choice under rs. 600/-,4
"Best ever headphones in this price range...Treble...10/10Bass...10/10 Both are equally balanced.... perfect match...If you are music lover this is made for you...And FOR PUBG best ever headphones....you can guess   enemy just listening footsteps....best surround sound...Must Buy earphones,  premium and quality sound in 599/-",5
#NAME?,3

"Premium build , good braided cable , buttons are tactile but I would have been better if the casing was of metal . Sound is very good especially bass is well pronounced, sometimes you can feel punch in the ears , mids are good , highs are good(not best) . Overall a good purchase.",5
"An awesome product from realme. Though I rated 5 stars, I have one issue. It's sound quality is awesome but whenever I use this headphone I had to remove the back cover cause it doesn't support.. otherwise u can surely go for it..very good product at this price.",5
No competition to these earphones...it can even give a tough competition to boat wireless earphones...as I personally compared both these earphones...and realms buds 2 came out as winners... you can't get any better option for this price range....and it even lasts longer .. I've been using since 10 months...and they are still in the same condition as delivered...Bass is just outstanding....and even my gaming performance has boosted since I've started using these...Pubg lovers ...you will de...,5
Build quality. - 5Soud quality - 4Bass quality - 4.4 ( some instrument sounds missing).. Ear fitness - 5 ( many more hours using. No pain) Price Wisely - ok. Good Over all - good product....... Thanks -R-,4
I habe purchased this after review but i habe to say that the sound quality is not that great as per the other customers are saying... tribble is too much & bass is not up to the mark...& When u listen this in low less tha 50pee volume the sound is good but u cant feel the bass in ears its that low & when u rise the volume more than 70per the tribble will tear your ears apart...its that much loudy...u cant enjoy music in this earphones....1st try this on ur own then bought it from here cause ...,3
Thank you you are so fast and your work  Sandeep sain is also fast thanks again,5
"There should be more bass like JBL headphones. After buying a realme earphone at rs 599, I now prefer to buy JBL worth 699.Work on bass this time.Rest are awesome.",3
"Very well balanced sound. Deep basslines, with no distortions at higher volumes. Value for money at 599!The magnetic eartips might seem useless, but that and the cable organizer do come in handy while keeping them away, as they remain tangle-free.",5
"The earphones are made up of good quality material that has a fine texture and seems durable. As far as the quality of sound is concerned, these earphones provide a good quality sound in this price range. The better you keep the longer they'll last.",5
"Get this amazing earphones from realme,great experience till now and found out that the mids are not that clear it's ok....ok, as well as the plastic body affects the design a lot,looks like an old gadget",5
With driver size of 11mm the best earphones with gvood bass perfect for everything... I like it.. the most .when I listen to .old songs . Love it for 600 rps .best quality overall,4
Build quality is awesome ...Bass is nice but don't expect much..Sound quality there is a lot of loudness but clarity is something that i guess is missing.,4
Best sound quality in this price bass and other tunes are great and loving. one time means all time best earphones and the quality on wires are great and longlasting.try........,5
Fantastic earphone.Must suggest.I use many head phone but this is best under 1500rs.One of the best i used.must buy.It's little uncomfortable in full volume it's best in one and two down volume...just go for it without any hesitation...love it.,4
Packaging is quite Messy and look like old but the earphones are sounds good if you're a shot of deep and heavy music listener then I personally recommend you Sennheiser cx 180 the built quality is not good on Sennheiser but definitely worth your money and sound far better then this realme Buds 2,4
This ear phones value for money but green colour is not good for look black is best for look. Bass quality is very super,4
"Sound quality is good but u have to adjust equaliser first for balance you want. Fits comfortably in ears, build quality is also a plus point, buds doesn't feel heavy in ears because of plastic body, button controls gives volume option which is good, bass is thumpy but not over boosted. Overall decent product according to its price range.",4
"Good Product i am un expected in this prich rang. In good sound quality and Bass. Design but ok normal. In this Product better than Cx180 (2/5), Buds 2 (4.5/5)....thanks to Realme....",5
"Good build quality.Doesn't seem cheap. Doest cause pain in the ear.Sounds is quite clear and bass is good enough.Highs and lows are okay too.In all, a great product , specially in 500-600 range. Even jbl etc whose starting range is at 800 something won't give you this quality.Also, they do tangle as times but that is understandable.The magnet keep the sadbuddhi together which is a good thing which most of the wired earphones lack specially under 1k segment.Go buy the product.",5
"I bought this product last 7,8 months ago and i still using it. Amazing performance amazing base and also designe is so classic and premium.In this price range i got what i really want to get. Thank you flipkart for fast delivery and also an amazing product.",5
"This review is being posted after 6 months of extensive usage, the ratings re as follows:Design/ Ergonomics 4.5/ 5Sound 4/ 5Bass 5/5Value for money 5/5Mic 5/5Buttons 5/5Trust me I've used many (around 20 different earphones) at this price and I can easily recommend this. The only earphones better at this price are Sennheiser CX180, that too is not for bass heads and has no mic or volume control buttons",5
This is an amazing product..I have used several earphones in this price category.among them this one amazed me..this sounds really good.. deep bass.. great build quality..3 buttons just amazing,5
"Best product in this price range.. Sound quality is just awesome nd bass is damm good.. Build quality and looks is also good. Best headphone i have ever used. U can blindly  go for it, if u a music lover.",5
bought this after watching watching top reviews Now I'm regretting it's not the product as described Bass is too low I mean too low only vocals and instruments 3.5/5 I am using 699 MI earphone when I am wearing that headphone sound quality between these two is like bose and boat I didn't expect from realme although build quality is awesome and cable organizer is great addition but I am disappointed I bought That MI earphone on 450 on 2019 big billion days DON'T BUY IT FOR BASS,3
"Great product with this price range. Realme proved it. I really liked the quality , the additional strap to fold the wire. Pretty decent earphone.",5
Awesome productPreviously i used boat earphones which are awesome but i upgraded to this as i was using relame 5 pro mobile. The sound was awesome as like of boat but the build quality is better than boat,4
This is really an amzing product.Got  it for 599rs.The quality of sound is amazing for the price.The durability and build quality is the best in class.It is very comfortable in the ears.I would recommend it 100%.You cannot get a better earphones than this one for this price.,5
"Excellent quality of sound.!!Have gone through all the detail in sound and i must say the performance of the product is much much better compared to others (Boat, Focal Sense, JBL etc.) in this price range.Drivers capability is superb even at Odd equalizer settings.If you want wired earbuds then go for it without any second thought.",5
First impression is good bulit quality is also super thank you for the good product realme.,4
One of the best earphones in the mid range..Best build quality as well as the best sound quality in the range...Mic quality is also best...,5
"With a little late in delivery, the product came neat and as promised.... Bass is great but the treble is very weak hence not good for pubg(the reason I bought).Also the surround sound is somewhat average, but so is the price. Go for it if you want to enjoy mucis only.",3
"Best earphones in this price.. best bass , sound clearity 💯. go for it . Amazing product 👌",5
one of the best wired earphones i have ever seen...deep bass... sees sound quality..but the cons is... lack of L-shape connector... over all it was a product...but the packege was... worst quality it seemed to be damaged..torn...i didn't expect this from Flipkart...i hope realme will bring another very innovative & also durable accessories like this... thank you..!!,4
"nice product in this range, build quality is good,sound and noise cancellation work well n enough long cableto enjoy your music experience",3
"Checked a lot of reviews before buying this and finally decided to go for it. Honestly, i didn’t get what i expected but then expectations comes at a cost and this one delivers almost everything u want in a “budget earphone”. Bass is terrific, vocals are not up to the mark ( at lower volume levels). Overall, if u are a bass lover and can compromise on other dimensions, this one is for you. Good luck.",4
Best earphone i have ever purchased..Its doesn't feel as it is 600Rs earphone but actually it sounds better than some costly earphones.Build quality is just superb..And earphone organiser is the best which you dnt get it in any other earphones..Bass is so punchy which i like very much.,5
"One of the best headset in this price range. Good sound quality, nice bass and good build quality too.",5
"Product is awesome, If you bass lover then it's worth purchasing go for it but the vocal is not clear but it's ok. High tone and low tone it's also well balanced. If you hear in high volume then it's hurt in your ear so listen on medium volume. Overall product is good no issue in this.",4
One of the best one available in this orice range. It's a perfect option for those who love bass.,5
It's really a good quality earphone balanced sound between lows and mids ... and it's built quality is not best but better than most other.. overall one of the best earphone in this price range,5
The bass is good low and mid are also good but the treble should be better otherwise a good earphone to buy.,4
Nice earphone with the superb sound quality and the built design   is very good. Very light and also comfortable to use.... overall nice product at this price rangeDescription of testing....Sound quality :- 9/10Built and design :- 10/10,5
"So I'm a pubg player & bought it after viewing reviews in youtube. Nd i can say that they are best earphones. Nice build quality, nice sound, mid nd bass are good. You'll not regret.",5
"Best Earphones you can get in this price, love the braided cable. Sound quality is top notch and it's loud as Frick! Bass is perfect, lows and mids are good and has a close to flat EQ. Go for it!Edit: it’s been six months now and this earphone is still a beast. I have faced zero problems and it’s super strong and durable. Lmao I have sat on it, smacked it against the wall and dropped it multiple times and it’s still good as new",5
A good wired Headset indeed. I am using Boat bass head 220 which is one of the best thing I hv used and this headset is not less than that. Bass is good and clarity of sound is also at its best. 4star from my side.,4
Sound quality and built is pretty good actually. Bass is not upto the mark. The only minor change is I wanted it to be L shaped. Other than this everything's absolutely worth it at this price range,5
Good product for this prize best clear sound and basss,4
Nice feel and good sound quality the build quality is impressive i am satisfied of this product,4
"Wonderful earphones with mid range price segment... Cant compare with JBL or Skullcandy earphones interms of Bass.... Earlier I used JBL T210.Apart from the bass quality remaining all upto the mark.Especially for PUBG players are blessed to have such Realme buds 2 earphone. No delays, Clear foot steps sounds and 360 degree coverage of surrounded sounds while playing pubg and listening songs.No earphone as of now to compare with this Realme buds.No second thought in buying this one.",5
This one is definitely better than the realme buds 1. It has surrounding sound good baas and a comfortable design.I really love the build quality also.,4
Fir this price this is the best earphone that you can buy....sound quality is so good....bass is awesome....I love Loud music and this earphone gives that...wire quality feels good enough to last longer.... just go for it....this one is bang for the buck....,5
Nice earphones. Built quality is also amazing. Sound is awesome 😍. This is the best earphones. Loved it,5
"Product is  must purchase type...However I expected good packing, it's not covered by plastic cover.The day I got this product, it was raining....It's just about the packagingBut I must say it's a good quality productThank you FlipkartNext time I expect a good packingThank you.....",5
"I've been using this headset for more than a month the audio output from this headset is worth more than the paid amount, it has such a great bass worth buying it.",5
Thanks Realme . I never expected.  It's too good quality and wire sound beat. I'm already using JBL and Skullcandy but. It's too reasonable price and awesome quality.  Guy's I suggest to you . Must go for it . My next order now Realme Earbuds.  Surprised🥰😘 thanks again. So happy and Fully satisfied about your product. JBL products you need to update yourself because price too much but quality no. So guy's go for realme earphone,5
Wow nice product Base nice fantastic ?I play Call of duity Game I am shocked if listen real sound Fantastic base ???,5
"Firstly, I'm buying this third time one for me and two for my friends, so you don't have to worry about this product, the rugged wired finish is awesome and is tangled free and also it comes with cable manager,Apart from it, when it comes to bass, it's tremendous, just like what the Indian users likes also the mid, lows and highs are quite good, i'm quite satisfied with this product.",5
realme buds 2 bass is good and audio quality toobut I have already used boat super bass 255f at this price 599 whose bass and audio level is same diff is realme drivers 11.2mm boat 10mm but I found the loudness and bass same so there is no diff with extra 1.2mm drivers in realme.I ordered this for extra bass whereas I found this same too as boat earphones.overall I give 4/5and 4.5/5to boat earphones,4
The sound quality is good regarding the price point.The problem with the sound is that it is more focused on the instrumental side rather than vocals. And the concequence is that it sounds little bizarre. If it mixed up the instrumental and vocals more balanced then it would have been more soothing to listen.,5
"Sound clarity is awesome...It does not distort at high volume and the vocals are clear even with high music in backgroundBass is kinda low punchyTrust me if you want good sound clarity and clear vocals this is the oneIf ur budget is a bit low say, rs 400 , then go for Boult audio bassbuds oakAnd choose the brown color...Have a nice day",5
this earphone is really awesome but the feature I don't like is it's not support on my device properly,4
Pro's: 1. Sound- Loud and clear.2. Bass - Too good for this price. Best under 10003. Call quality and mic - Very good.4. Build quality - Nylon braided cable.Cons but not really: 1. Headphone jack with/without gold coating doesn't matter much for normal usage.2. Headphone jack shape could be better if it would be in L shape. But it mitigates the cable life by providing nylon braided wire. Normal wires with straight headphone jack will worn out soon after regular usage.,5
"These are the best earphones, great bass and clear voice. It is better than sennheiser cx180 street.5 out of 5.",5
Cool and super durability. Good to say about the bass. Bass is more than expected. So I recommend to look at it,5
"Bass isn't thumpy, but it's hydraulised. I enjoy it! ಠ_ಠYou can cannot use this earphone at a higher volume, actually you can not increase your volume than 65%, it will cause your earpain if you take it further.Other than that, I love it! The wire arrangement shack is just making the work easier!!! Don't think much, just go for it!",4
"This is very Affordable In terms of Price, Design and Quality. Quality is much appreciated and Sound clarity is awsome. We can hear even a tiny detail very clear. I like em a lot.",5
Must buyIt's build quallity is very good.Mostly untornable & tangle free.Sound quallity is pretty good in this price range.Base is quite good also.No other headphones in this price range are as good as it.,5
"Amazing product in a decent price. Amazing sound, the thing which I like that it comes with 3 touch button for multiple use. Highly recommended for pubg 😁😉 it will give you sound of enemies very clearly. Overall a good product in this price range.Must buy ❤️",5
Nice earphone and also nice  built qualityI recommended under 600 earphone and also like realme brand made in india product,5
"Writing this review after using for 5 months.Pros.•loud - useful while watching videos having low volume also while talking on phone also sound quality is good•good quality cable- braided cable is strong than most of the earphones I have used.•mic is very good- catches even in small volume, much better than others I have used.•sound- bass is slightly boosted in this one, highs, lows, mids are good too.Cons.•plastic though fine buts doesn't feel premium enough•using it for too long in ...",4

This headset is best this price range.no gold plated 3.5 mm jack.but cabile is Breeded and good quality.i am not recommended for gamming.,5
"Earphones are very good, specially build wise, provides tangle free experience but fitting is not that good in my opinion, Mi earphone had much better fitting. Overall very good product.",4

Then this is one for youThe build quality is just awesome , no doubt about it Sound quality is excellent looking for the price tag The base is amazing , U will get amazed after listening . In last if we consider the price point it really is a deal maker . Just Go for It.",4
"Good for this price range. If you're a bass lover and like to listen to music and make phone calls via earphones, it'll be worth it.",4
Review after 10days of use.I got it in rupee 599.Base is very high if u like base go for it. I like soft sound but it doesn't have otherwise ok ok .When u put it into your ear u will not be able to listen sound outside the environment even if the volume is low.Sound quality is very good.I m using this in realme 3 pro. The only problem with this earphone is it should be like L-SHAPED jack which is missing.,4
"It's almost 4 months after buying the headphone and I'm writing the review of it while listening to the music with that headphone. Before that I was using JBL headphone( I can't exactly remember the price of it). But believe me both the headphones are really good. In some cases (Bass, maintaining the same sound quality at  max level of volume)  Realme Headset is slightly better than JBL. But I feel more comfortable with JBL. But I can assure you that it's one of  the best headphones in this p...",5
This is an awesome product from realme.The build quality is just too good and very promising.The sound quality is also decent for such a budget earphone.The packaging of realme is also admirable.,5
"Brilliant sound quality and build quality.If you're looking for a budget headphones go for this, cable is of good quality and dont get tangled easily unlike others.Bass is excellent and it has a very good overall sound quality. I used senheiser cx180 earlier, comparing with it realme has also a competitive sound quality.This headphone has very good microphone with noise cancellation . Go for it!!",5
"Great set of earbuds for the price. Very very nicely build. Sund quality is also way better than its price. Exceypurchase for the budget. And the eartips ar a blessing . No pain, doesn't fall off the ear . Just an absolutely great purchase",5
"In-short overall quality is in between mi earphone(Rs 799) and CX180(Rs 1049)tips:-   there are 3 different size caps available in package S M & L            use these caps to adjust lows, mids, and highs.           1. if you want everything same as earphone has, use default cap i.e size M.           2. if you need more bass then use size L caps           3. for low bass and high trouble with clear vocals use size S capsand one more thing, no doubt this is the best earphones at this pr...",4
It surpass everything that you expect from a sub 500 Rs earphone. One thing worth mentioning is the earbuds are extremely comfortable to wear. You can wear these earphone for whole day without feeling any discomfort. I use the extra earbuds provided by realme for my other headphones.,4
Believe me..Close your eyes and buy it 😍Bass was too good Sound quality excellent Best for gameing in this price range specially for pubg lovers Music experience is very very satisfied Love it Delivery in 22 hours flipcart 💕,5
"At this price range, the best wired headphone.Though I expected the bass a little better, but it's okayThe sound quality is smoothGreat headphones for pop, rock, remix and DJYou also get 2 extra pair of buds of different sizes.The volume control is usefulThough the magnetic feature didn't helped a lotSummarizing, a pretty great headphone at a low price and I definitely suggest you to buy it",4

Best Headphones in the market at present. I feel price 600rs is little bit high. Another headphones like Boult is also good it comes under 449rs but you don't get volume button in it. Whatever I am fully satisfied with the headphones,5
Nice quality nice baas nice sound I love it,4
So this is an honest review .. i am using these headset for about a month now and i must have to say that you will not get such a headset at this price point .. The Bass is just awesome.. the mids and lows are fine .. Works with pubg perfectly .. they are comfortable too .. i can wear it for more than 6 hours without no problem .. the audio quality is great considering the price .. And one thing about the noise cancellation .. it is really appreciable considering the point .. Guys if u have a...,5
GOOD EAR PHONE EVER I SEEN THIS IS BEST ONE         EXCELLENT BUILD IS ALSO EXCELLENT              BASS IS AWESOME,5
Nice product with great build quality......extra ordinary bass...i love this product...best for PUBG and for enjoying music...call was aalso the best..off this segment....M happy to choose this product,5
I love bass so it really works for me pluss its inbuilt n structure is strong enough  so it wont get torn out easily its been 2 weeks n it runs smoothly ..loved it❤️,5
"So I have been using Antaudio wave 506 and boat baseheads 225 for a while, and this realme earphone is quite good as compared to these two earphones.If Iam asked to chose one, I would chose realme buds 2. But , if you are the one who loves to listen music at 100% volume with best bass, I would suggest you to buy boat baseheads 225 or 220.",5
"Awesome quality earphones in this price segment.first of all design and build quality is awesome , calls through headphone mic is crystal clear and sound quality and bass is awesome .If you confused between boat bassheads 220 and realme buds 2 ,as i have used both of them i would say pay 50 rupees more and blindly go for realme buds 2 ...it will give you a premium earphone quality sound",5
"It is the best available earphones in this budget segment.Highly recommended for all purposes either it for listening songs, playing games like pubg, freefire, call of duty etc..I would love to have L shape jack in upcoming realme earphone with gold plated finishing.",5
"This is the ultra genuin and very honest review.Built quality excellent,sound quality is good(no one can give in this price) but not the best.every utuber said that this earphone has high bass unfortunately its not true,however comparison wise may be better than other in this price range.but the truth is the bass is avrage (below).the real bass u can imagine is like apple basic earpods.but no company even 5k 6k priced earphones cant give that much of bass. If u r a bass lover like me go for a...",5
Very good product in budget It is good for gaming also It's bass is boosted which is so nice to listen,5
"+ve : crisp and clear mid. Good for melody songs.OK : Adjustable low/treble sound.-ve : Bass is boosted, it doesn't have the depth. You can't feel the punch.For Rs.575/-, this is a 4 star deal.",4
The best product from the filpkart as earphone and best value for money and outstanding performance with powerful bass and clear audio and awesome product,5
"Sound quality is just awesome..... But only suitable for realme phone... It doesn't get support on asus handset... Thank you so much.... It's a value for money product. If u r using realme handset, just go for this wired headset blindly",5
I don't know why people give 5 stars for this product . The product is not great . The bass is acceptable but the treble should have been improved more. The build quality is not great at all .. overall an average product for me .,3
Head phone is good but if you are searching a headphone for PUBG it is not for you ..You can't hear a foot steps clearly .. And other important sounds in pubg but if you want a headphone for music and videos so go for it sound quality is good and build quality is awesome ..,5
Awesome product under 600Rs i purchase this to my friend his also very happy and he love to listen soung while using this headset.. u can also experience this.,5
It's a very good earphones with this price range.I love it and very good sound experience and i recommend it.,5
Bass is high but not good Sound quality is also not good Ordered after some seen some good reviews but now I m not okay with it...sorry realmeBuild quality is okay Wires are awesome but buttons are so cheaper,2
Wow superb quality and service packages is so nice thanks for FLIPKART and very very fast delivery am so happy,5
"It's a great pair of earphones for this range. In terms of sound quality it's really surprising. 1.Sound quality:The sound quality at this range was surprising. The bass is not over boosted but is enhanced well. Midtones and trebles are not crisp but better. Would not like to complain much for the pricing. Overall sound wise it's an amazing product.2.Microphone quality: the other party didn't have a problem while on the call, said the voice was clear. 3: Built quality:Braided cable is ...",5
"This earphone worth every penny, u will get best sound quality,and an amazing bass as well, material used is also quite good,Overall it is an Excellent product.",5
Every thing is good except the sound clarity as it sound less sharp and more dull with any sound for example when playing games like Pubg the gun sound and footstep is not clear as  compare to other in price points. The 3d sound is very low You can not identify the location clearly,5
Ear phones are really good but the only problem is with mic.At first proper voice is been heard by receiver on call but later on it is just going lower and lower. And the last thing it should have L shaped microphone jack with gold plating.. Overall at this price product is a fair deal.,4
"First of all I would like to thanks Flipkart within an awesome delivery speed , I got it delivered within 18hours. Paying 599 for this earphones are worth .The sound quality is awesome , in the bass department no one can do it better than realme , the only con is that the headphone jack, which doesn't seems durable, if it would be a L shape jack then the durability may have increased , I think realme must improve it . The wire quality is good and I can't be broken or torn , the earphones lo...",5
"Good one.. fits well in ears.. I like it for all kinds of music.. For calls, I would not say its great but good.",5
"Am using realme buds 2 last 5 days.  Really best product . Sound quality,  bass is good and clear.  Tangle free wire.. fit and comfortable for ear. Value for money.  Am very happy for it. I used boat earphone 220. Heavy metal, fall down problem, not good bass. So compared to boat 220 , realme buds 2 very nice. If u searching wired earphone, u must try it...",5
"It definitely satisfy your expectations.. bass is punchy, sound clarity is good enough, build is awesome.. The bottons only look like not great is not clicky.. value for money, best headphone under 600 for who bass lovers",4
Really very awesome sound quality and also very stylish and comes in very nominal price so I think i was my correct choice and bass and tribal is perfect.,5
Best for gamers!Writing this review after 5 days of use. It's has soft bass (you don't get headache)Voice clarity is wonderful. Background noise cancellation is great. Crisp sound quality. Wire is lengthy. Bass could be better at this price range.,4
"Wow, really nice for hear the music ,good bassI really like it, realme product is always super nice",4
"Nice sound quality, good grip on ear...bass lil bit more according to me... but who loves soft music..is perfect for them..",4

"First of all great service by Flipkart amidst the Lockdown. Delivered the package within just 2 days!! Well coming to the review part, I was very skeptical about this product as I was using JBL earphones for last 4 years but eventually decided to go with it. Trust me guys I was amazed by the sound quality it produced. The highs, mids and low are crisp and to add up, it has got enough bass. Although I must say that it gets too loud when played at full capacity so recommend to use it with lower...",4

Woo hoooo 💯% feel the music wow it's amazing thank you Flipkart,5
Nice product.. Good sound but I would prefer my boat earphones over this as they have better bass and overall sound quality. I liked the build quality and magnetic eartips are handy. If you want good bass and sound quality go for boat earphones if not then go for this....,4
Sound quality much better to compare someoneBass is enough to hearTurn the more than one song to protect the earConclusion Sound Beats is needed little bit clarity,4
Great Built Quality Recommended 100% Best Buy........ Trust me i am Musician..... (DRUMMER) Great Sound...... Quality with Bass and Treble....,4

Supebb ; nice ; comfortable & well designed ..i loved iT,5
Overall Decent Product with good sound.Low volume button needs to be hard pressed to reduce volume else doesn't work on normal push - The only disappointing thing which my friend too had experienced in Feb 2020 and returned it.Sound quality is good over call and the earbuds are perfect fit.Reviews based on a single day usage.,3
Very nice built this earphone. Bass is average.and sound quality good in comparison of mi earphones it is the best go for it if you want to buy on this range.,5

"Great sound, great bass.. Awesome product. Also came with good package quality and  fast delivery. good experience with Flipkart as it has always been.",5
Package was slightly damped but there was no damage to the product and i must say earphones are quiet good enough for its price range i even odered one for my best friend for hia bday gift and hee iss such a music enthusias thats why i can say that he ll like this alot bcoz its really have a good amount off bass and sound is also clear i liked it in the price of 599 the earphone is not an bad option but this review iss only after 3 days usgae i will use it more and update my review again  whe...,5
It's base is amazing and sound quality is good but not best but I am satisfied in this price,4
The built quality is superb... But the sound is a problem. The mids and lows arent that great here. However if your vol is above 70% youll enjoy the bass really well. I don't know why but when the sound is below or at 60% the treble and vocals are so aoft and not clear enough. So if budget is at bay and you are thinking of a bass centric in ear headphone u can go for it.,5
The sound quality of this earphones are very nice and easy to wear it . Nice product by realme,5
"Awesome product just love it ...... the build quality is top notch , it got a pure bass and the sound is also loud the noise cancellation works greatly and the sound quality is just mindblowing.......... ❤❤❤",5

Amazing built quality and a unique color to have. It's been months since i got mine and despite regular harsh use i haven't found any faults. For me it is a life saver when Bluetooth devices die.All in all nice product with amazing built quality.,5
Good in sound quality good base also best for playing games like pubg or tpp fpp games good build quality but I always say don't use roughly anything it's is expensive but who wants best sound quality and build they can go for it and realme users can definitely go for this headphone👍,5
Very good product😘Im satisfied with this one 😘Best for pubg...😘😘Foot steps are clear 😘😘Music quality is superb😍😍Bass is very good 👌Premium packing and best quality product ever😘Love you realme😍,5
Earing quality is well good and im satisfied with it but the jack should have been more durable as it should be more supportive I sometimes feel that it gets tampered when bent....,4
It's a good product in this price range...the audio quality is far better than other earbuds available on this price range.i am quite satisfied with the product.,5
It's a very good product with a great bass quality I bought it for pubg nd its sound quality is op. Also it's jack is so prtotectable 🤘🏻🤘🏻I'm happy with it,5

"Sound quality is good 👍 bass is fantastic , colours is attractive  cable is pretty good, cable organiser is helpfull.",4
"Special thanks to Realme for this product. Crystal clear sound with superb bass thanks to 11.2mm bass driver. For bass lovers its really a good earphone and also good for others. In 599 it's really a good choice. The quality of wire is really good and the quality of the microphone is excellent. The design is awesome, the feedback from buttons are really really good. Once again thanks to Realme and also thanks to Flipkart for fastest delivery.",5
"Worth every penny!  This earphone is best under 1k budget, bass is not that much great,But it's not  bad either good highs and awesome mids(loud and clear), so the verdict is: if you are searching for an earphone under 1k then it's the one for you!",5
Awesome sound clarity and nice bass. It sounds like Jbl signature sound.,5
Excellent earphones the sound stage and the bass is amazing..it feels like a premium budget earphone..must buy if u expect a good earphone for great sound with excellent punchy bass...when listeningI'm feel like in the live concernt...,5
Its ok not good as skullcandy smokinBuds 2 which i am previously using.. Overall decent product not heavy bass but good bass with good vocals n ol. Build quality is also decent in tbis price of 600 Go for it with 6 months warranty..lky,3
Very nice product to buy under 1k... beautiful design with long good quality chord..Sound quality is excellentIn my opinion..buy realme buds 2 rather then realme buds.,5
"Bass heavy, not good for playing PUBG Mobile. EDM lovers will love the earphones, but classical & vocal listeners won't like them because of the deep bass effect. Overall 4 stars. Better than Mi headphones.",4
Wid in this budget im happy that a best earphones with great features and quality im now njoying music keep u updated after few months of usageUpdate ... Best earphones for bass lovers amazing bass and quality loved it,5
"Best headphones in this price range, specially when u have realme mobile phone ... Just loved it...superb for games also... Like pubg , COD... Overall loved it ❤️ but it gives headache after continue long use (2hrs+)",5
Adbhut earphone haiin one of the best of best earphone in his segment price range 10 on 10 product . I love this product thanks Realme,5
"Best earphones at this price, in fact it can compete with earphones at 2k plus range. Awesome overall sound, bass is always present not overwhelming but always in the mix. It's a treat for Metal, Trance, Spotify, Prime Music. Built quality is also very good along with the looks. Only one issue is the jack, which is straight and not bend, thus sometimes doesn't fit properly. The Best option... Better than Jbl, Boat.",5
They sound extremely good for the price and even sound better than some headphones in the 2000rs range and their bass is amazing. They're also extremely durable and water resistant i would say...they have been in the washing machine and they still work fine. Overall amazing product.,5
Build Quality is good but sound quality is normal. Good for gaming like pubg but not good for listening music.,3
Sounds quality is really good. Vocals good too . But they claim gr8 bass . I personally feel boat basshead 225 is a better deal due to better bass and sound quality is similar + it is cheaper . I'd say go for boat,4
"Very good product for price paid. Sound quality is perfect, bass is perfect, worth for price, strong and durable wire, I'm satisfied with the product.",5
Nice deal with Flipkart..a good earphone with great bass nd genuine sound quality..must buy it ..if yr budget is under 700 /800,4
It's A Perfect Choice Who Loves Bass More Then Anything....So it's Most Affordable Headphone Which Comes Under Such A Lowest Price Along With Awesome Sound n Bass...- Nitin Kr Nishant.,5
One of the best earphones I used...very good quality wise superb,5
"Outstanding earphones definitely better than Xiaomi, Jbl, Boat, sennheiser, etcWire quality is excellent and braidedSound quality is phenomenal for the price i have 12k galaxy buds+ it's almost similar in sound quality to it",5
Loved this one. At this price I guess you won't get any better deal. Build quality is great !.,5
More punchier sound experience than all other brands available in this price segment and even from those whose price are upto Rs 900. I only can say that this is best masterpiece you could buy for your ears . Go for it blindly if your budget is Rs 600 or even if Rs  700.I will soon update my experience in a week or two regarding its build quality and  all otherthings that I could fetch. Also Thanks to the delivery person for being cooperative in this COVID Era. He had all safety measures wit...,5
Amazing sound reproduction and a perfect balance of bass with clear mids highs and lows ! Love it just amazed with these buds 2. Feels better dan my JBL C100si and one more piston fit that I was using for a long time !Blown wid the performance !,5
Really amazing sound. Monster type bass. Perfect for pubg and daily use. And i would really love to thank flipkart for the one day delivery at this point of time.,5
Great experience..At lower volume you will crystal clear sound and good bass...Want more bass increase the lowBut genuinely for headphones below 1000/- they are the best.Go fot it....,4
Great product at this price range with good overall sound quality. Go for it if u are in a tight budget it's worth it👍,4
"The build quality is premium but one buys earpieces for listening  to music not just for the sake of longevity, tones are well balanced. But these are barely bassy. For most part it felt bland to me. No points for the bass. If you are looking for best bass in budget, go for Boat bass head 225. You will thank me later!",2
Best earphones within this price range.Pros--1-Best design2-Balanced bass3-Treble is excellent4-Nice build and finish.Cons--1-Not gold plated jack2-Jack should be of TITLED designBut overall according to the price point it is the best earphone you can get now.,5
"Sound quality is best compatible with Realme phone,   Average for Asus. Build quality is not superior to previous Realme buds. An average earphone with very high price. Cannot listen songs for more time. Sound punches in ear may cause pain . My Nokia basic earphone is better than this. I would honestly suggest, don't buy it if you don't have Realme phone.",3
"Realme buds 2 is really a great product at this price point , realme has tunned it really well ,bass ,treble,vocal ,all are is in equal proportion,and it will bang your ears on high volume because of its thumping bass and creal vocals ,go for it guys ,at this price point nothing is better than this.",5
Previously I was using boat rockerz 255 so if I compare this earphone with that one then... - bass is amazing like boat - lightweight compare to boat- sound quality is amazing clear and tribble is amazing- magnetic feature is also cool- build quality is fine Worth to buy ??,5
Just tried by viewing the reviews and at last it's totally unexpected.. Good sound quality.. Soft buds.. U can wear for long hours too.. Best in this range!.. Good one go for it,5
Nice Headphone at this range. And especially Bass awsm. Design and wire type also awsm. Finally value for Money. Packing and delivery also Very nice. Delivery person behaviour also very calm and nice. Thank you flipkart and Seller.,5
The realme buds 2 have problem after 2 months of use the sound outputs becomes dull... It could be better the earphone is good and the voice is crispy and bass is very good but it does not provide surround sound it fires the voice directly so you won't feel surround sound so if you love boosted bass and direct sound go for it. Build quality is also better. But if you want balanced sound and surround sound then go for samsung ehs64 in these price range it would be better option bcoz this realm...,4
They are the best to buy in this budget range. If one is looking for build quality with sound quality then it's the best and everything is great in it.,5
at first thank u Flipkart for delivering this product at this difficult time I am very happy with fast delivery of the product.if I talk about the earphones this earphones is one of the best earphones I ever experienced build quality sound quality design  are extremely well at this price I recommend every one to buy this earphone those who fond of music.,5
Pretty good at price point and strong . but not satisfied because it doesn't deliver true sound like apple wired earpod.,4

"The main highlight is the bass that's offered at this price point. So surprised that the bass is actually so strong & punchy in this price range. Even the mids & highs are good but the bass is amazing. The bass is definitely better than skull candy, JBL & boat earphones.",5
"Good product, value of money....i ordered this earphone something i am writing for this earphone.. Its is good built quality, bass is nice, sound quality is above average but when use earphone some things analyse its sound is very loaded....... But in this range of 600rs is good.

I am thankful to flipk...",4
Very good product such as branded feel When you use. And there is a band for adjust the length. One more covering is there  with in wire. I have got 2 pairs of buds can use as the size of our Ear hole. I realy recommending the same. No noise disturbances from outside  once we insert into ear. Look Like a standard brand. Anyone can buy without any doubts... thank you Realme and Thank you Flipcart for such a quality product.. 😍😍😍😍😍 iam Giving 5* on this,5
Best in budget class.Just go for it. 599 it's a steal. Build quality is best.Sound clearity is good better than Mi earphone under 1k.,4
Everything is superb just except the mic. The mic works well only when i stick it to my mouth which is not possible all the time like i am doing everything with one hand and holding mic with one which is equivalent to holding a phone and also while playing any game like pubg you have to hold mic near your mouth for speaking properly and think how you are going to do that and then buy :) Also please change the design of the jack. It is hard to plug it when the phone is with a cover whereas oth...,4
Guys hold my 🍺Let me explain its awesome earphone best ever I have experienced best sound bass quality I loved it lovely sweet sound I m using in rog 2 dts sound...go for it,5
"I have bought the green color but it's not exactly the same as shown on Flipkart.Anyways sound quality is great at this price point. Good control buttons.And thank you Flipkart, received the delivery in 2 days. Awesome service in this pandemic situation. Hats off.",5
"I used a lot of  headphones & and I am related electric musical instrument. So I have basic knowledge about headphones and music. The headphone was pretty good in terms of price the best quality was awesome and the vocals are clear but there is a some little bit of issue Who is this headphone the headphone not comes with gold plated headphone jack and I found little bit of problem with my device to connect with this headphone & it's also not a ""L"" shape. (And one more thing that I want to ad...",4
"The best earphone I have used . I also used Sony,JBL,boat and realme buds but this is the best one . It's bass is excellent . I will prefer you to buy this. A very excellent product by realme. I loved it very much.",5
Best at 599INR. BASS is really good even overall sound quality is great. I've used MI earphones before but They have nothing extraordinary. Mi earphones break after 6 months and also bass is too low. Vocals are decent. But Realme buds have richer bass and vocals. Even Realme buds 2 are ligher. Cable is also more strong and tangle free. Go for it If you have a budget of 600INR.,5
"First of all.. the green colour is awesome😍, looking so premium, and the sound quality in this price range no one can defeat, bass is just fantastic, u will fall in love with this..Trust me it will be over the expectationGo for it👍🏻Highly recommendedIf u  thought that ur budget is low u can go for it.. It is better than any other earphones under 1kBut i didn't get the cable organizer 😒Bass, trouble and the other side all of nicely balancedIt is soo comfortable to wear for a long time",5
This is really cool and amazing but this is better for gaming like pubg in this price range,5
The build quality is awesome i think it uses Kevlar materal on bottom and rubber on top which is awesome and is comfortable if you are newly using a earphone.Sound are awesome clear and bass,4
"Awesome headphone, good sound nd realy awesome bass quality in this price range,, Love you Flipkart nd Realme..🤟😍",5

This is my first Realme product.. I have been using MI headphone before.. I was satisfied with that product..I'm a bass lover.. So I decided to buy this one..Pros:*Sound Quality: I like the sound quality.. not the best bass.. but good bass with sound quality.. I play PUBG a lot.. that's why bought this one.. it didn't disappoint me.. 8/10*Design: It's design is good enough.. different materials used.. overall good.. It should have L shaped connector.. but it'd conventional type one.. it ...,5
Good earphone of around 1.5-2 metre but bass is not very good like realme bud 1 and sound is very high in comparison of same .,3
Totally bang on 🔥 . Fabulous bass controll and sound clarity in full volume.. no noisy sound.no sound break.. best in the price ..Giving it a 4 star only because I didn't like the rope type wire through the plug..That's my personal disliking at all... Otherwise this headphone has nothing to be a second choice .,4
Nice Product good sound quality. Totality loves the product and i satisfied with the product.,5
Wowsome Product... Realme now being a trusted brand... I was surprised by its sound quality and thumping bass... I would be ignoring my Bluetooth headphones for a long time?Even best for Pubg? Thank you realme?,5
✓Best in market for the price point.✓Good quality bass.✓Bass not too loud and we can easily use it to play pubg like games. We can easily hear left/right footsteps.✓Wires are tangle free and strong in built quality.✓Feels comfortable after long time of use. ®If you are low in budget go for it you won't regret.,5
Earphones are really Good ... I love his build quality and ... All top to bottom disign really appreciate !!!,4
"If you're already a realme user then you better what realme is famous for.......It's all products are amazing as like Realme Buds 2 ...So,just don't think more buy it ....The specification which has been given about these  is absolutely correct.",5
"Its good, if you compare with mi 699rs earphone, it has good bass and more sound. But mi is better in sound quality but less sound production. Its at cheaper price soo i will definitely recommend it.",5
"I am giving 4 stars because the treble component in these earphones are little low as compared to dual driver earphones .Rest all other things like volume, bass and comfort are up to mark. Recommended",4
Me n my love has been using it for last 9 months n found no issue in sound quality.bass is balanced with perfect design.its amazing to hear clear sound bit by bit.value for money indeed.,4
"After so much reserch i decide to buy this buds and its worth every penny, awesome bass and music and very nice for pubg too..♥️",5
"For 600 bucks, go for them.If you are on a tight budget, want good bass and clear audio, go for it. The crispness ie. treble is not that good. But these sound overall a very little better than my 1000 bucks One More Piston Fit.Braided cable should've been till the top.Headphone jack should've been 90 degrees. Noob work on jack.Still construction is far better than sennheiser, sony etc.If new version of these come, then wait for them (till now no news).Save yourself the agony of digging ...",4
Super look & cool sound quality..... love this product.... thank you flipkart.....,5

the best wired head phones ever had at a reasonable price especially the sound quality of this earphones is really good and these base boosted headphones probably the best ear phones ever had seriously.....,5
"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone.",4
The Product is very nice and the Quality is also fairly good as compared to the Price of the product. Go for it 👍,5
earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .,4
I would like to give 4 * for sound quality and 5 star for bass and loudness of the earpiece....But in durability it is best...Housing is made of mettle and the wire is fabricated from jack to separation cord and earpiece cord is made of good quality rubber which you can say by touching it ....Even it is working perfectly after shocked in water occasionally but thats not done on purpose its all accidents happened cause i forget it in my pocket and washed them with cloths...Ear comfort m...,5
Nice headset but you will find that rubber tie strip bit annoying while using and helpful at the time of keeping aside depends. Length of wire is pretty good. Sound quality is very good in this price range.,4
great quality. I bought based on reviews and thank them for genuine reviews. these really good for price. instead of paying other price for one or 2 months,5
Nice airphone🤩 ⏩ design is awesome ⏩ sound quality is very good ⏩ bass is excellent,5

It's of good quality. I used JBL headphones before But the problem with JBL is it's wire quality. In wire quality this are very good.. sound quality is good but not better than JBL. Best buy at the price of 600 rs. You can definitely go for it.,4
Awesome earphone sound quality is outstanding and i love the bass ... superb .....,5
Mind blowing purchaseThis is very important and perfect quality.. It's very good bass quality and good build qualityThis is budget earphones realme buds 2...It is amazing and cargo.... Thanks Realme...,5
"I am using this headphone for 1 week now. Build is decent, wire length is good. Wire quality is good. You can control the volume as well as pause play from the headphone itself. Punchy bass but not super bass heavy, mids and lows are decent as well. Overall a great VFM headfone.",4
"More bass and vocals are low...if you are a bass lover then this one is for you...i don't like the vocals personally vocals are too low, you can not enjoy raps bcoz of vocals, also call quality is not good you can't listen opposite person quite clearly...mic is decent... overall value for money for music...not for call communication...",5
really happy with the price and product you can buy this without even checking other brands at this price point i really happy and i am an apple user before i used apple earphone so i term of base and mids and high realme buds are similar to apple earphone not as same as apple but similar to apple and price matter it just 599 rupee and apple earphone is really costly so at this price point this is just great! mic quality is not as same as apple but its really good. so without any doubt go for...,5

"I have been using Realme Buds 2 for 15 days now. To be honest,build quality - 10/10.vocals - 9/10.bass - 9/10. (considering you get an 11.2 mm bass boost driver)Comfort - 10/10You get extra silicon buds to make it more comfortable.length of wire is long enough, but sometimes it is irritating as wire comes in between the work you do.Wire organizer does a great job here, really useful.I would have been better is the 3.5mm jack would have been golden.Really good for gaming like pubg, c...",4
"Sound quality is nice and the bass was not so much fun ... and even the 3D songs effect does not support which i was expecting.. Otherwise, the quality is very good.",4

Very nice product. If play next setting is also available in it then it will be perfect and will deserve 5 star ratings,4

Magnetic clasp , three button remote , metal shell earbud construction , braided cable plus points for the built . Punchy bass , clear highs , vast soundstage and clear sound make it sound very pleasant. Cons - Only two things lacking on this earphone considering it's price are i) Absence of L shaped cable ii) Mids ( Vocals) are good but not great . The cable manager also helps in keeping...",4

Earphones are good design and build quality is good but as I switched from JBL it has disappointed me as if I invested ₹100 more I would get really 2times better quality JBL 160T. Only the benefit is build quality it would really last long,4

it's really amazing and it's sound quality is perfectly alright . IAM pubg player so it's a better option for me because by the help of this I listen the footstep sound of enemys in pubg,4
I was eager to check the earphones when I got them. I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. Pros:- Build quality is good. the wires are braided in fibre I think from the earphone splitting point to the jack. The wires of individual earphones are also built with a tough material.- The sound quality is good at this price ( I bought it for 499) compared to what other products offer.- The bass is good at the medium volume. - It's a really good earphone in this price range when ...,4
"Review after 2 weeks...Before this i used mi earphones,i loved that one but damaged easily and did't work after 7,8 months so ordered this and I'm impressed with quality.bass is not that good but loved the sound quality is awesome.",5
"Using these earphones from 15 days now with my realme X2 and it works perfectly fine, good sound quality and built quality is also good specially the wire and love the holding strap, it's very useful",5

Realme buds 2 is absolutely best earphone.Don't search for any other just go and bought it.My choice and favorite earphone is realme buds 2.Design and build quality is good ??Sound quality is good ?I recommend you to bought it ???,5
Realme proved their worth..a classy headset.. awesome design as well with good build quality,5
"excellent performance its range super quality and sound perfect for realme phones, like a hometheatre best product in this price go for it..value of money,praise vasool....",5
Having a good bass not meant that earphones are best the realme buds provide a decent performance.I loved it's built quality.,3
"I am writing this review after 20 days of using earphone , from my experience few points note1. Sound quality are better than Sony MDR .2. BASS quality as little better than others.3. Handy to use , soft material .4. Price are little high as compared to boat earphone.",5

This is awesome product good bass and clear sound..thnku realme for good product👍👍,5
"Surround quality is ok, not good. For the price of 600 its worth if your priority is build quality and bass. But if your priority is surround sound and medium bass then go for JBL C150SI.Realme earbuds 2 is not for gaming, for gaming i always prefer Boat rockerz 510 in headphones and  sennheiser CX213( i was using it for last 3 years, its buds got lost so had to buy new ones). If you have Dolby Atmos support in your smartphone and you need good build quality then for realme buds 2 or else b...",3
Sound quality is good compared to the other branded headset in this price range. Cable organizer is very useful and build quality is amazing ....,5
Good product. Build quality is awesome considering the price. Bass is not so great but good. Sound quality is something you'll never find in this price segment on other earphones. Absolutely loved it.,5
"Disappointed from realme ..exactly after 6 months Mike is not working ... Most  importantly 3 mm jack is not working properly automatic sound decrease   and Right, Left is not working I can't play 8d music",2
"Product is Very Promising at such price range, Sound is awesome with crisp clear bass & surround effects...Strong wire with magnetic earphones it will give perfect sound by tweaking some Dolby option.One word I loved it & definitely advise people can go for it without any hesitation, I liked it more than mid range JBL earphones.",5
everything is just perfect except the in ear fitting the small ear tips r not going in ear so fitting might be lil better over all value for money product sound quality is awsome go for it,4
The sound quality is quite good .I have used MI basic before this and expected some more details in bass but not so much difference . The mic works really good .Over all this headphone could be sold in 100rs off .I will recomend Boat 242 which is 500 and worth of its money.,4
"average productRight ear of headset not work while calling. and also the 2nd person not hear the sound clearly while talking Overall it is good for listening to audio,video . but not good for calling",4
Best earphones i have used... definitely better that boat....n great thing is that i liked its mic....its jst superb,5
I usually prefer headphones for rough usage and with good built in quality. This headphones satisfied my need. Good audio quality with baseNoice cancellation facilityAwesome qualityDecent packingOverall a better earphones. I prefer price is little high.Overall I suggest u can prefer this if you are regular user. Thank you Flipkart,5
Looks good and fits good... Sound clarity is clear and nice..Except the jack it doesn't fit tight and it is not gold one..,4
"really a nice product.. nice sound quality.. nice bass (as same in jbl) .. and easily fits .... but logo of realme gets scratched because of magnetsso in that case realme can do better in its design quality... but rest, it is a very nice product",4
I have been using this earphones from the past one week and the sound quality is great .if you are a base lover you will love these earphones .half of the cable is braided. I expect from realme that in the next generation of these earphones the whole earphone will get a braided cable.,5
"The best earphone at this price range.good sound quality and awesome bass.It has an magnet in it,its very useful to carrying.Overall i am happy with it..",5
Wow amazing i mean i wish i can give 10 star sound quality is so good .Noise cancellation is super far better than boat💓💓♥️♥️🍾,5
"Very good product.. sound quality is above expectations in this price tag.. I've bought two buds.. green and orange variant.. both are great.. extra ear buds are provided in the box, extra earbuds are of different sizes and very useful.. cord organiser is a good move.. inbuilt mic and volume rocker button is good.. you can also change your song, play/ pause using the middle one..",5
"Really mind blowing product, i am always afraid about the earphones that are sold online as which one is better to choose .So I finally decided to buy this one based in recommendations plus reviews but let's be honest this product is far better then any good brand ..It can be compared with senhieser that means this earphone is really great with great bass , crystal . clear sound . Don't think much just buy it",5
1. Sound Quality is good for the price.2. Good quality of buds and mic. 3. Good package and safe delivery by flipkart.This earphones are the best for value for money compare with other brands all features has being satisfied.,4
Good bass. But if you are looking for 8d experience it is not worth it. Otherwise amazing sound quality and bass,4
"Best budget earphone ever✌️love it... I used it almost 3months and it is just wow... very comfortable, lite,.. Bass is like Boom.. Boom🥁🥁 This is worth Believe me guys..🎧🎧",4
So comfortable in the ear as well as its sound too so soft and bass to not hurt the ear. best making by realme ever. I became a fan.,5
Can't Explain in word outstanding and thank to Flipkart  for faster delivery.. with in 2 Days. Without compare you can go for it.,5
"I don't know this will it benefit you or not? Yes dear reader am talking to you 🙄 . I must say this earphone is not the best in terms of sound ,built ,loudness . I rate the sound 3 because u will definitely find that it's loud bt it is tuned very straight u will feel the lack of crisp sound which comes from instrumentThe price is good 👍 so u can go for it. But don't expect that unique  crystal sound which distinguish the vocals the mettalic  the bass. Ys it has bass but the reviews that it...",4
It's bass is the best under the 1k budget segment but overall sound quality (vocals) could have been improved. Hope they will do it in their buds 3. I will definitely recommend this if you want earphones under 1k. Kudos to Realme.,5
"Bass is good in these buds and quality is also awesome but audio output is not upto the mark for games like pubg ,here audio output is satisfactory otherwise the overall quality of the product is good.",4
the earphone is good for bass lover sound quality also nice at the price point but if you listen it at full volume for more than 30 mni after that you get little head paining,4
Nice sound quality at this price and design is also awesome. And best things are one is cable organizer and 2nd one is magnet in buds .these two things are very helpful,5
The best ear phone sound quality is good and base is very clear to lesen such a best earphone,5
Bass is super but while talking on call voice is not that clear and crispy...Lookiwise design is good but doesn't fit in ear as expected. Slips from ear.,4
It is a best earphones and excellent build quality and excellent base and the buttons are are very premium quality and we had magnetic earphone major plus point and mids are ok but in this price very best for value money in 499 rupees I buy in offer in this price but it is 599 rupees best earphones value for money and you can keep in any mobiles same sound quality only come have using on realme mobiles and Vivo oppo Nokia mobiles I use this earphones same sound was coming it best value for money,4
Very good earphones better than the MI Earphones and mi basic wired earphones have so much to improve to come to this range of sound but a thing which is not told by any body isDon't expect much bass as it is a earphone not headphone,5
Value for money.... sounds quality is awesome ...and especially the quality of bass is fabulous ...and also the bilt quality is good ....,5
Awesome product I'm a boat user after using this headphone the bass is much better than the boat if you are a bass lover go for it,5
Earphone has good build quality and has good sound.But flipkart send me a used earphone. The seal of company product is preopend and the innerpacking of extra eartips is also open. It feels it is used by someone. This decreases my faith in flipkart,4
"just awesome , beautiful build quality ,nd magnificent bass ,elegant color combination, best in the market",5
Awesome earphones at this price range. You get everything that you expect from a good earphone. Balanced sound quality with powerful bass.Just feels a bit heavy on ear.,5
Amazing product!!! Worth every penny. You can't get better earbuds than this at this price. The braided wire gives you more protection from any damage. It will last longer for sure.Thank you Flipkart !!!,5
Its just been one day I bought it and i can say that its just perfect for Pubg gaming and as well as for musicits. surround sound is just too good that i can easily find my enemy in pubg and about the sound quality in music its just perfect and premium,5
"Real Me Buds 2 !! Woohooo !!!!!What an Item I should say ! This  is Best  earphone you could get in this price range other tha Boat Bassheads 225 ( which has the same quality in bulild & sound)..   The Treble  and  Bass are equally managed which brings you a better satisfaction...  The built Quality,  metal ear piece with magnet,  braided cable,  straight 3.5mm Audio port,  3 switch Remote,  and also the rubber piece  which helps you to tie the earphone when not needed...  these are the t...",5
Decent sound quality and great build quality to be honest in this price range this thing is one of the best,4
Just I love it this phone is awesome best pubg awesome bass just awesome,5
"Awesome real bass & sound quality really loved this and most better than boat headset, If u hear songs more than hours it won't creates head ache like boat, If u got plan to buy a headset with excellent quality of headset go & buy this without hesitation 👍🔥🔥🔥💥👌 only disadvantage is not an L shaped jack & not an gold plated jack👎",5
"awesome sound quality faadu bass I'm loving it , wow I'm so happy .",5
The biuld quality of this earphone is is no doubt awesome looks quite premium..its sound is also decent but if we go in depth review then you will find that its bass is little low and treble is also Not 100% good...overall this earphone is good...but if you really need the best sound in this price then ho for redmi earphone @699.,4
Super awesome product from realme. Earlier I used mi headphones but this is far better than mi. Go for it.,5

thanks from flipkart that it delivered this beautiful earphone in 2 days........I'm in love with this earphone........ I'm a bass loving guy and this peice of beauty just got it what I wanted....... thanks realme,5
Works fine with even 40 percent of volume as its base and treble is great in loudness even in this percentage and its magnetic earbuds are fancy and is good and wire is braided  in good material only to half of wire and other half is of good quality but isn't great overall *it is a good headset with good sound result* flipkart assured is fast in delivery and the mic gets problem and doesn't function after the validity expires but still audio is good never trust the mic for long term use,5
It's work nice supper fast deliver sound quality is too good,5
"Immaculate ❤️.From the build quality to the soundscape, realme has truly hit the sweet spot. Well balanced everything.In the end I wanna say just one thing ~ Looks good sounds good.Kudos realme with this one.🔥🔥🤙",5
"I think it's value for money,better than boat,Rich bass and of course better build quality than cx 180&jbl c150,compared to that ,it lacks the smoothness and vocal clarity a little bit,mids are high and bass is really good,if u want pure sound quality I suggest u to go for jbl c150 it has much more smoothness and orginality than this,but if u r in tight budget and want to have Rich bass & above average sound quality then I suggest u to go blindly for it.worth 600 bucks,just have some minor is...",4

I love to say u guy .. k...,5
Pretty good earphones....... Sound is better in its way as well as the bass......... The bass does not disturb sound quality.... Both at its bestest...... No need of full up volume..... Medium sound plays pretty good.....noise canceling is super good ....button controls are making problems sometimes.... Mic quality is not that good ... And no voice control..... But a best earphones under this range....... With good build in quality..cable handler ... And awesome experience.,5
best earphone under 600 rs. Really worth it. good mid tones and bass. One of the best build quality wires and earphone i have ever seen. Go for it.,4
Everything is good but bass is not up to the mark. Bass is just good not best Edit*After using 6months left side earphone stopped working,5
Believe me when i say this is the best earphone under rs 600 bass is perfectly superb in mixture of treble and surround sound i just love it whole new experience even bass heads lover would love it close ur eyes and just buy it and the build quality is also the best part more than value for money superb earphone.,5
"Mind Blowing Purchase, I loved than jbl C100Si sound is vibrant and very strong cable looks wise awesome",5
It's the best ever earphone I have ever used. I did a lot of research and finally came to conclusion to buy it. The sound quality is pretty nice and the bass makes it more charming.,5
"Very very fast delivery, nd product also good, I like Realme Brand products, was so amazing sound quality, I recommend to buy this Earphone👍👍👍",5
"Just bought it today and writing this review after using it till night.Bass is deep and clearVocals are clearLoud enoughNoise cancellation is amazingOverall a good deal for Rs. 599But i felt the magnets for a wired earphones are of no use and i dont think the strap that is provided to wrap the earphones up are going to be of much use but u can remove the strap since it's a rubbered one, so not a problem! Go grab it if ur looking for a best earphone under 600. I've bought this pair of e...",5
"Best earphones for Enhanced Bass experience, built quality is also good.. but Earpeace is a bit large so comes out of ears easily if accidentally hit by ur hand or anything.. i can say music experience is good in under 500 .. actual price is 599.. try n get it under 500 in sales.. else Mi earphones are aslo good in price of 399",5
It's okay. Neither too boombasstic like boat which comes in the same price range. No Lshaped pin makes it a little uneasy to put the phone in the pocket while driving. Doesn't go well with tight jeans. Fits well in ear though. Very light-weight. You wouldn't know if it's there. Excellent noise cancellation. Suitable for games like Pubg and Freefire. Conclusion: Best for normal heads*...kaam chalau earphones for bassheads* like me. xDD,4
Best ever wired headset I have ever bought bass is awesome sound quality is awesome and built quality is also of top notch must but terrific earphones best for pubg and it produces enemies footsteps sound very loud and good quality must buy for pubg,5
It is one of the best earphones at this price point. Has a very good bass and sound quality is really awesome. Build quality is also decent enough. Cables are easy to manage and magnetic buds really help a lot. Fits nice in ears. A great choice for Pubg players😂.Overall a good deal at this price. A must buy product 👍.,5
Nice product and good sound quality design is good worth to buy at this price...,5
"One of the best earphones that I have used in my entire life. Premium quality bass, good vocals. Also cable is designed tangle-free. Extremely satisfied with my purchase and also got a 2-day delivery for this product.",5
Realme ear buds design is good and sound quality is excellent if you can be under 499 price is good but 599is not good u can also go with boats earbuds metallic finishing,3
"Review after a week usage:Design is good, wish that the upper wire quality be same as the lower ones.Sound quality is good but not greatBass is averageVocals are clear very goodI use it daily for mostly calls and a few minutes music, hence for me it's a good earphone for Rs 500If you are a basehead, then it's not for you.",4
"It's  a great earphone with super built quality and great  bass. This time realme has done a great job. don't think just buy, it will make you amazed. 😎😎👍👍",5
The earphone is quite good but the cost is little bit high otherwise it is good for general use.,4
"Sound quality is very good 👍 and design of a headphones comfortable,I like the color..very happy to get good voice headphone..thank you Flipkart.",5
It is a very nice sound and it is a very nice earphone with a very sweet sound,5
As compared to other earphones at this price range it's pretty good in base and built quality      But don't expect that much sound quality     If you have money better to go with others,4
"Very Nice Product. Bought it for 599. Delivery was on time and I'm Happy with the product. I'm Using it for my Redmi Note 3. The volume buttons on the earphone is working properly in it. After some months the wire begin to smell, most probably because it is absorbing the sweat and moisture.",5
it is ok ok ear buds. it has good bass not great sound quality. it just seems entry level buds. My old mi ear phone I using which is in around 400 RS is still better in sound quality,3
ON high volume the sound is not clearbass is excellent For me my ears are getting little bit warmer when listing for much longer periodbuilt quality is awesome,4
its fantastic at this pric range ... built quality is good and looks durable and sound quality is also very good .. bass is also very nice,5
"Works well, not too bass oriented one, just good for casual listening, balanced one working flawlessly, build to last, decent headset.",4
Nice products realme making ever what a earphone nice sound quality like a over headed.  Last  one year in have using over headed of boat but now I bought realme buds I didn't remember I had overheaded,5
"Great Bass as promised. Clarity awesome. Build quality Good. Cable seems to be tuff. Comfort great. Mic clear.Controls neat and perfectI use Spotify which has an equaliser on Android. Don't Bass boost in the app above 50%. Play with the EQ to get your comfort sound. Also use High Quality music setting in the App. I tried: Skullcandy, Boult, Boat under 1000/- but this one outperformed.",5
"Hands down, one of the best budget earphones. The design and build will outstand you. Rubber wire near the ear, braided wire at the bottom. Strong jack, clear microphone and great microphone distance from the mouth. It even has a cable tie to prevent tangles. Superb sound and one of the loudest earphones I've used. Bass is great as well with overall balanced sound. You can't get any better within the 1k price range yet!!!",5
Just osm🤩🤩🤩🤗🤗i am fully impressed about this realme buds 2 sound and bass quality...buit quality is better in this price segment.11.2mm bass boster is increse bass.🤗🤗😋but one thing i notice my realme buds2  sound brokers is not working😑😑😑😑🙄 ovaral is a great product.i ever seen.🤩🤩🤩,4
Sound and Build quality is great but the only complaint by me is the quality of the connector that's established on the 3.5mm headphone jack. If you're not careful while removing it from your phone it might break. Honest to God that is the only con that I have faced otherwise it's a pretty great earphone.,4
"Very good , The loudest and the clearest sounds in this range , The tribble is little bit more when you listen it in full volume , Bass is excellent, It gives best sound at 70% volume , which is also very loud and clear , I just loved it .",4
nice product. good quality material with good sound and amazing bass. one of the best one in this price segment. good work realme and good work by flipkart for fast delivery.,5
good product nice sound quality. vocals traps mids highs lows all good but bass is just okay at places where needed only not punchy or not too heavy just fine..,4
crystal clear audio output....nice bass.....superb quality.....10/10 Vara level earbuds ..... fastest delivery by Flipkart...... thank you REALME for this amazing product,5
"Good earphones for the price. bass is just okay. vocals great. treble is also fine. comfortable on the ear even for long durations. For some reason mic doesn't work when I use for Skype on my laptop. But, it works well on phone. The earphones looks good and it is durable.",4
love nice good super 👌 wow 😍,5
"it's really good and  i think if you want to buy a budget earphones then you should try this, the bass quality is too good and it's wire is literally nice they also provide the magnet it's too Impressive but keep in mind it's also a Chinese product!😅",5

over all awesome product ... perfect for music lover with amazing bass..and if brought in sales day than its a unbeatable... best earphone under 1k,4
20-1-2020Initial review on Day 1.I will re-edit this after 1month.So my day 1 experience is good with these Realme buds 2.Let me tell you any headphone takes a while to give its best and it takes few weeks of usage for that.So right now i have used these for about 40 mins and listening to saved music in Poweramp as well as built in normal player and then lastly played songs on youtube.I would say it sounds great on PowerAmp.As far as youtube or online stream concerned i would say the o...,4
very nicely made by realme . good job . it will be better if realme also inculde these earphones with their mobiles and also oneplus phones should bundle these earphones as oneplus has never made the efforts of bundling earphones in any of their phones in the past n the present.,5
sound and bass is awesome .. I love this headphone with my new realme 3i ... awesome lovely ...,5
"Good quality earphones, build quality is good. The sound clarity is a bit low. high volume and nice bass. Hope they would improve sound clarity in future 😊",4
best earphones under 1000 go for it better then Mi and Boat earphones and wire of the earphone is so good i am using since 4 months,5
"Good bass, good stability in ear, good sound quality and the cable organiser is also of great use 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",5
This is the best earphone I have used so far......my previous earphone was jbl....it's better than that ....as they say the bass is awesome....no need to turn on any Dolby or extra feature in phone..... design & build quality is superb......one minor problem is that while watching movies vocals are not clear in some part coz of heavy bass otherwise it's superb....don't go for all those  famous brands.....realme doing a great job....well done.,5
one of the product at reasonable prices...!! built quality osm.. sound quality osm.. totally all over best product at this price.. worth to buy this product..,5
"If you are comparing between this earphone and boat bass head then i will suggest go for this one, because this one has more sound clarity and it fits perfectly in the ear which you can't experience in boat bass head. But the boat has slightly more bass than this one but if i will talk about the overall experience then its simply awesome considering its price point. You can easily compare this earphone with some of the jbl earphone  which comes under similar price range like T160,C150SI etc.",5
Best in Class... Perhaps this is the best ever earphone i ever had... if you are planning to buy earphone within 1000 rs probably this is the only i recommend you to go for. believe me you won't regret. just go for it man don't look for anything else.. yes just go for it. click on the buy now button and it's  yours. enjoy the rich experience of music.,5
nice quality nd bass  clarity should be upgraded leaving this product is simply  superb.without second option we can take .don't sound clarity is not it is good but little upgrade should be done .,5
Great earphone at this price range. Bass is at its best. Will highly recommend for those who are looking earphone between 500-1000 rs range. All the music notes are clearly audible. The built is just awesome. Value for money product. Well done REALME.,4
I will definitely recommend others to buy this headphone. There is a lot of improvement happened in this Ear buds 2 from the previous one. you will definitely love the design and bass effect which is equivalent to 899 or 1299 Rs earphones. Thank you Realme you are doing a great job to satisfy your customer.,5
"The overall design is good,it would be good if the whole cable was braided. The sound quality is good but bass is not punchy, good for people who loves medium bass and good vocals. 500 would be a good price for it",5
This headphone is awesome i luv this i recommend buy this best price best quality,5
bass is good compared to other earphone in this range sound quality is great liked it but the buttons are not good in quality and the thing that's missing is L shaped jack.but you cannot expect much at this price range,4
this earphone is quite good ....as compare to other earphones of this range ....bass is normal but sound quality is good ....finally I told you this is best option.,5
in love with these earphones. if you are looking for a very nice earphones for music and movies this would be the best in all in this range.best sound quality great build great work by realme,5
I love this product 😍 in this prize segment.👍for best voice quality and ❤️for best build quality fast delivery ..,5
this earphones is really nice very very very nice sound quality & bass so nice osm built quality I like realme buds 2,5
amazing earphone i have ever used...in the starting i was little bit confused all about the earphone because i switched from sony earphones but after using 1 week i experienced this earbuds..and im happy...that these buds are great ... best and durable,5
"earphones  looks amazing ,  sound quality , bass , treble  everything is upto the mark,. But most important feature is the build quality, the braided wire is  very  flexible and not easily breakable. earphones fit snugly in the ear. overall at this price of Rs. 600 ,one could  definately buy this product",5
surely this will satisfy you at this price range I never expected that this headphone will be this much good I am very happy about. if anyone looking to buy this earphone close your eyes and you can buy it,5
Sound quality of the headset is good the bass is not so high or not so low it is in sweet spot the vocals sounds good too and the quality of wire is good too it is braded so it will last longer.,4
PLZ NOTE!!If you're having Android 10 device then you will face a problem with increasing the volume via earphone buttons. I'm having Moto one power and when increasing the volume via the earphone buttons google assistant is popping up everytime...other functionality are working well.I think the buttons aren't compatible with Android 10 and also in Windows 10 the total button functionality can't be used.It's the best in this price.The boat 220/225 earphone just has a little more loudness an...,4
"Guys it is really a fabulous earphones at this price range .. I've using this for the past 3 months and i hav to say, the sound quality is remarkable , really, really great, and the bass was quite impressive!! If wheather you're buying this for PUBG u can definitely go for it only if ur phone supports ultra sound otherwise i wouldn't recommend it. Overall I would give it a solid 9/10 .",5
best product at this price range I love this earphone damn what a bass nothing can compete with this earphone just go for it u ll love it I'm sure thank me later,4
"Totally love with this budget earphone. Realme brings real smile after listening the sound quality from the earphones.Noise cancellation is there, Bass quality is fair enough, in short if any marks given to this earphone I'll give 9/10?",5
These headphones are totally amazing at 599/- it beats every headphones available in the market under 1500/- price tag. Buy it with close eyes I guranteed the sound quality is not amazing but excellent in this price range.,5
very good  quality. sounda clarity excellent.  bass is there...  powerful sound cant listen at high volume because  it is too loud..  overall good  my rating 4/5,5
must buy product... if you want good sound quality... if for only style purpose you go for Bluetooth earphones... really nice product 👌 thank you flipkart,4
"1)Build quality is very good. 2) Durable . 1) Bass is not much good like Boat 2) At high volume , sound not clear and shuffle lot.3)It's a medium sound and medium BASS output. I tested earphone with KGF 1 songs . Missing lot of  excellent and clear tunes with this earphone . hope , realme next time considers these points .",3
Build quality is very good.Bass is overpowered. The sound is not balanced.sennhieser cx180 is better option if you like balanced sound.Bass is heavy so we cant hear mids properly.so if you love bass then you can go for it but if you want balanced sound go for another earphones.,3
Awesome  Headphone  . Love the built quality Love the Bass.  Awesome package,5
superb bass and awsm sound quality. good when u use it for calling purpose also. And the wire quality is also so good in this price range.,5
awesome product at perfect price. Super bass & perfect sound quality. Just love it so much.,5
Realme Buds 2 Are Really Good Earphone and the Cable Organizer Is Trully The Best only the Vocal Should be more improved But The Bass Is excellent And Overall tha earphone is best in this price,4
"one of the best earphones in this price range. The sound quality is of top class. If I come to the point of bass the eopper will be the boult bassloops. But If I talk about the overall sound quality, design the first boy of the class is Realme Buds 2. Very good earphones in this price range. You can go with it.",5
"The best bass you can get in around 600. I was initially skeptical about realme but rating of 4.5 and good customer reviews lured me to order one. Now, after roughly 10 days of usage I'm highly satisfied with the product and it's sound quality. I have a Sony MDR EX15 which costed me Rs. 1200/- but the bass of realme beats it. You get 11mm driver just at around 600!. I highly recommend it",5
Very well product quality 👌sound quality 4.8/5.0 Really whenever I listen songs and watching video using this earphones it feels like I am in theatre. A very dynamic product from realme 👍,5
"When an item has got plethora of rave reviews, you expect it to impress you largely. Sadly, Realme Buds 2 didn't do so! Except for a decent sound quality and soundscape, the headset is so mediocre. The built quality is durable and it can easily last for a year, I guess. But, who on earth can just hold on to this ordinary soundin' headset just because it is durable! Perhaps, the compatibility can be the issue with it. If your handset is any of Samsung M series, forget buying this. Or if you ca...",3
bass is too good better dan jbl earphones only problem is it darins ur phones battery little fast Dan jbl but u get good sound fr dat,4
Magnet & tie are simply eye catching in this range. Clear sound. Volume control should have been improved a bit. Overall best designed n quality.,5
very rugged earfone in this price segment.i am completely satisfied wid this earfone but if realme could provide whole braided cable then it will be worth every penny.As mentioned in the box the bass is superb but the vocal is little bit low but it's negligible.out of 10 i will rate it 7 just because of half braided and half polypropylene cable.otherwise it will be 9 out of 10.apart from this the delivery was on time.and finally thanks to flipkart.,4
Its good for the price but I suggest jbl cs150si because it has much better bass compared to realme buds 2 also i have tested with 3 other earphones In bassMivi thunder beats =10/10Senhiser cx 180 = 10/9Jbl cs150si           =10/8Realme buds 2.    = 10/7And in terms of sound quality all are best the best of best under 1000 is senhiser cx180 it is the beast also in sale you will get mivi thunder beats for 1099 rs in this price thunder beats are killing deal and also for bass lovers mivi ...,5
good price and better than JBL ear phones in this price segment l Like it. best pick😍😍,3
sounds quality is very good and bass is balanced that feel good bass overall good earphones,5
great bass. average quality. build quality superb but durability less than avarage.1st piece received faulty.paining in ear when listening music long termfitting good but better in mi earphones,3
Pretty good loking headphone. Bass is superb. Clarity is also decent. You get mic+volume buttons along with play/pause button. All in a single product. You can definitely consider this for your next buy.,5
"damn!! realme this has just insane quality sound, I mean i just can't explain how happy i am being a bass lover also soft music!! Yes this sounds far better than Sony, jbl, sennheiser etc!! And lastly I would say Mi you are big zero in front of realme right now!! upgrade your accessories!!!",5
"Really awsome, Ear blast earphones, I was brought boAt headset 15 days earlier but not satisfied and realme beats the boAt. worth of money, thank a lot to flipkart for this product. I want give 10 stars out of 5.",5
tese earphones are good enough to give you good experience..but build quality is not good..and  putting magnet behind earphones.. does not make sense..also only black pair headphones are best ... option..other colour codes bare not good ...and ..,3
"Product 🤩was Really good 👌 tangle free wire not an ""L type joke"" 😒 top class😇 in bass solid built  magnetic buds ,😍...over all really good 👍",5
good sound quality and build quality is good but price is too high and black and yellow colour looks great than green colour....,4
"The headphones are good and they sound decent like Boat 220, JBL T100 and every other decent headphones. But as the reviews say, there is nothing extraordinary or unique about. I believe this is the myth about selling a new product by adding oriented reviews. Thanks Flipkart for a the quick delivery!",4
Sound quality is awesome but not clear as senhizer but as compared to senhizer it's difference of only few  clearity built quality is good but its gold plated cord company should improve this and rest of quality is same as senhizer only sound clearity is too less as senhizer bass is equal as senhizer and biggest thing is that its budget earphones with extra ear buds,4
I know how it feels when u find the best products... I feel the same with this earphone... build quality... sound quality... mic quality for call... everything is top notch... I am actually in love with this beast...,5
very nice sounds good Basse good quality iam happy total Mark 10/10,5
"These earphones are steal. Bass is outstanding. Good thing is bass is not disturbing other frequencies (mids, highs). Vocal are clear enough but I won't say outstanding. Instrument seperation is very nice similar to any other earphones under the price of 2000. Build quality is excellent but personally I don't like the yellow accent because it's funky for myself. If you want earphones under 500 I'll recommend to go with Honor AM115 it has same sound quality but the build is just above average....",5
nice thanks to ekart boy super nice super special thanks to ekart  boy mukesh Rathore,5
Very good product in this price. I was using boat 225 earphone earlier but this is better than boat 225. Overall best product in this price point.,5

If you  want a good budget earphone then this is the the earphone you want to buy because it is a a good earphone with decent prize.THE BASS AND THE SOUND CLARITY IS GOOD.overall I will rate this product 4.5 out of 5The only thing is not good is  the back of the earphones got scratched because of frequently use of magnets to keep the earphones organized. those got scratches within a week. otherwise it's A GOOD AND NICE PRODUCT.,5
"This realme buds 2 have balanced highs,mids and lows of a sound frequency and this is better than mi basic earphones but pure bass is mi basic earphones.realme buds 2 are also have bass but use bass boosters",5
After a Week of normal use i can say that the product is just awesome. REALME BUDS 2 Perfectly justify its price.Sound- 4/5Bass- 5\5Built Quality- 4/5 (The half of the Wire isn't kevlar coated)P.S.- I'm very happy that realme buds 2 has a cable organizer.One Of The Best Product I've purchased from flipkart.,5

It's good though.",5
"better than realme buds 1, bass is clear not high. better u can buy  offline products. because you can check its sound . you don't have offline stores near u . this is prefect in Flipkart",4
"A perfect one...just bought recently. I am quite happy with this product...loud sound, super bass, easily fits in ear, easy to handle....must go for it",4
Reviewing after 6 months ....Sound quality is so amazing that you can compare it with other big brands like jbl sony and other and believe me u cant get better option than this in 1000 rupee segment....If u are basshead than just go for it blindly .....Noise cancellation is also amazing ...Build quality is just amazing......,5

I order a lot from Flipkart and never had an issue. This time I received a damaged product and the issue is that it's not returnable. I didn't checked that while ordering. Suggestions to users and Flipkart- please create a clear visibility or message popup for non returnable items as customer feels helpless when gets a damaged product by cant do anything.,1

"Built quality is top notch but sound quality is same as 200, 300 rupees earphones , sound quality is not as aspected",3
"Everything thing is fine for me but there is a cache ,it doesn't fit in my realme 5 pro device which is just  unacceptable",5
These are the worst headphones i ever used I buy these earphones by only seeing the views and comment but these are the worst.It causes ear pain🥴,1
Pros:Great Earphones at such a low price. Deep Bass. Awesome sound quality. Works great for playing PUBG.Cons:Only one disadvantage is that you cannot wear it for too long. The buds are not that good and cause irritation in the ears.,4

Good earphone,5
good enough..,5
"Sound is very loud, but bass is not as highlited. Vocal Quality is also not that good compared to MI BASIC EARPHONE. Build quality is awesome. I would suggest to buy MI BASIC EARPHONE at lowest price (399) than this. Because I am using both, so I can feel the deference.",3
Worst product and worst quality no bass nothing sounds like secunderabad 50rs headset,1
Extra base disturbed pubg sound.,1
Bass and sound quality is not upto expected in this range....boat 225 earphones has much better sound and bass in the same price range.Noise cancellation of realme 2 buds is also less than boat 225 earphones.Don't waste your money on this product,1
"I got a used earphone . Pack was not sealed, user manual was absent , earphone is dirty and even wire is damaged at some spots. The seller from which it came was FIGHT CLUB so I suggest all to not buy from them.I never had such experience with other shopping agencies. It was my worst experience with Flipkart , I have raised a issue to return it and I am expecting a positive response from them.",1
Fraud.!!! Got a totally different product... Not same.. money waste...!!! Horrible experience,1
"Dont buy this product beacuse bass is really bad and sound quality is worst, u will itching at ur ears after some days, i think the ear buds are not good",1
"You can go for buying this. In the price range of 500 Only, If more then go for BOAT.",4
Earphones right side not working i bought earphones  2 months ago.,1
It is not suited for my poco F1.. while using some noise on headset ... It's irritated.. more disappointing ...,1
"build  quality okay,but sound  is not good.not clear and having pain on ear after playing songs.not recommended. horrible",1
i have compared this head phone with Sennheiser cx 180 ...and these(realme) are poor in bass and loudness and and don't like fitting.,1
"I got Mi Earphone instead of realme buds 2 so i return it, but the realme buds 2 sound quality is good, 2 things of realme buds 2 is dissatisfied me ""the L shape of 3.5mm connector"","" the gold plated 3.5mm jack""",1
"Awesome, must buy product. Build quality 10/10. Bass 10/10. Trust me you won't be able to hear noise around you. Surround sound is good. Good for PUBG and Call of Duty. In this price segment best headphone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Trust me you won't regret it.",5

Updating my review after using it for 2 months.No issues in sound but issues on call .when on call other person listens a lot of irritating noise,2
Awesome earphones in all i buy till now❤️And its too good for pubg player 😅,5
Best budget earphone under 600 rs. easily beat 1000 to 1500 rs. Earphones best build quality best sound quality & loud bass fully satisfy,5
The orenge color is not good.It doesn't look good. Feel cheap quality. Black colour is very good.,4
i would recommend mi earphone over real me . because they really have a balancing bass and treble.,4

"At the Range of 500/- I think Realme buds 2 is The best budget Earphone. The 11.2mm driver provides excellent bass, & Sound/Build quality is really above expectation. Tangle free cable & Magnetic Ear Bud makes it even more Premium. Buy it you will be satisfied..",5
Cheap and best with affordable price. Its sound quality  is gud with bass too.,5
I have been using this headphones from 1.5year I'm soo satisfied no other products can't beat this in this process segment,5

Product is awesome sound cliarity is fabulous Bass booster outstanding Avg 4.8/5,5
I think bass overpowered that I couldn't hear vocals properly also hear bass part which doesn't exist and feels uncomfortable wear for long time also tried changing eartips can't fix if you looking for audio quality and bass go for other headset like JBL ... If you are bassheads just give importance to only bass.....Hmmmm........                                           GO FOR IT,3

Good battery 🔋 👌 Sound awesome 👌 Bass 🔊  super Overall good 👍  product in one plus,5
Very nice product with amazing battery back up and deep bass.. Awsome sound clarity.it is very flexible  Length of wire is little low.,5
This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesom then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i god 40% of remaining charger. i changed this  neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.,4
"I've been using this product for the last 3 days. This might be too early to write an elaborate review but I've known enough about this neckband to be ""eligible"".1. Sound Quality: The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me. Whether it's about mid frequencies, vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even the lower frequencies, this neckband deals all of those with superior performance. Undoubtedly.2. Bass: Bass is...",5
"Excellent quality.. Packing is awesome.. Neckband quality is impressive its very Soft rubber, light weight.. Sound quality is very nice.. And bass is impressive.. Backup is approx 14 to 15 hours easily  in medium volume.. Very fast Bluetooth connectivity and switching.. Type c charging cable.. I think it is best in this Price range.",5
This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.,5
Quality is very goodAndSound and bass is also very good But battery is not good Battery backup is not 17hours Battery backup only 10 hours on full volumeAnd this earphone is very good on all condition But battery is not on markAnd 10 to 12 it charge 70 to 80 and playback time upto 8 hoursAnd it completely charge in 20 to 30 minutes But no warning for low batteryI check two time i can not seen low battery warningOverall great product in this price,5
"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/52. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.3. Comfort is Pretty good. 5/5.4. Battery is also really good. 5/5.",4
If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me  🤬,1
It was a fantastic experience using this earpiece its just awesome and i loved it like anything it has all the features qnd a definitely good base with good sound quality..i was bit unhappy with its clarity else i was really impressed by its working,5
"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ...",4
The quality of the headphone is awesome. Easy to connect to any mobile and PC. Sound quality and bass are satisfactory and worth every penny. Go for it!,5
Bought these headphones 3 weeks backPros:1. excellent build quality2. Great bass and sound3. light weight and handy4. gives me 10hrs of battery back up5. really good quick chargeCons:1. Missing quick switch button,4
Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.,5
Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying,3
Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.,5
"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good",5
"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazing I will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ...",5
Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.,5
No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.,4
This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience,1
"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side. And low latency mode best in this price range...even with a non-Oneplus device( I've a Samsung phone ). Overall valu...",4

I really don't understand why this magnetic power on and off is inbuilt when maximum backup is only one day. Its useless feature as of mine.

Although it's a good gadget as far as earphones goes the one major flaw is we can't change songs using volume buttons......Which is basically the biggest boon of using any bluetooth earphones....So when we are doing something and wanna change the track we have no choice but to do it using our phone ......which in my opinion sucks.....When you have to do it using the phone anyway what's the upside of having a bluetooth earphone ....even a cheap quality 50 rupees wired earphone have the same...,3

Best In this Range....... Blindly Go for it I'm writing this review after using for 30 Days*Microphone is working smoothly*Battery Backup is more than mentioned*Connecting time is 2 sec max *Fitting in ear is perfect (Customise with 3 Extra Sets of Buds)*Easy to carry*Sound is best in the range but it can be improved*Bass also need improvement,4
This buds gives such a good quality experience of listening. Fine bass and good build quality. Bt battery backup stands extremely good . I have purchased this Bud's 10 days ago since then I got fine performance from this buds.I must say worth of every Penny I spent on it.,4
If u want earbuds for gaming like pubgm and cod and listening to music go for it If u want for call purpose go for some other cause u have to speak very very loud so that the other person could hear my voice but all the rest things are perfect specially battery backup is so good I almost get atleast 7 hours at 70% volume when gaming from when i take the buds out of the charging caseThe design is good.There is no led in buds but only one in charging case to show that the case is charging o...,5
Good proudct excellent ear buds nice sound good battery backup nice design and very light weight.Thanks realme........Fabulous product by realme🙏🙏👍👍👌👌🍫🍫,5
The product is best and sound quality also best and beti so nice range also nice disadvantages after 7 days the right earbud will not work it will work but charging will not support you should clean the box and you should keep the charging and it works you don't think that the right earbud is not working to be working but it won't get charged through you should clean one time and you will do charge means you will get charged Atlas I control my speech by saying that the real world so nice name...,3
"Best noise cancelling buds for this priceEven though it has no noise cancelling!It's pretty good and bass is awesome and sound quality is also good, I can literally hear the lyrics even I'm standing in the crowd and it fits perfect that you won't hear outside noise at all.",5
Bought them in 1499 20 days ago...battery is 2 hrs for songs 1.5 hrs for call for a single bud. But the box can fully charge them in 30 minutes so no problem ..mic connectivity during call is also very good seems like hd calling but for a better experience you may require a calm place. Overall with brand support like real me one can buy blindfull,5

If you're an audiophile don't go for it, though sounds good but it would disappoint you.2) Bass is good. Cons:-1) You would hate it for its turbulences.

You can use this only for hearing songs not suitable for calls,3

"Disgusting and horrible product, stop getting connected to Bluetooth in next day and they are also not refunding the amount as well as not accepting the replacement order ,waste of money , not expected such kind of horrible service from flipkart",1
"I purchased this headset on Oct 26, 2020. Till last month(Feb 2021), it was good. But after 6 months, the sound quality in right headset became very poor. It was like, I can't hear it. My headset lasted for only 4 months (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb). I suggest not to buy this product, if you are searching for a long lasting headset.",2
In riding on bike the mic was not good we want to stop the bike and want to speak,1
Sound n bass is so good . But touchpad was not properly working ......😡😠🤬🤬🤬,1
Review after using 7 days. It is over all a good product. Treble is not good but yes depends on song quality as well. Bass is good. Battery backup is also good. Noise cancellation is passive not as per my expectation. But it is not recommended for calling. Mic is not for calling.,4
Excellent productSound quality is awesomeOutstanding battery backupLight weight so easy to carryBest in fit,5

One side is not working.,1
Great Earbud in this price segment sound is louder and clear also the mice quality is very good didn't face any issues during call.. If you are looking for a Earbud believe me this can be your budget option...,4
"earbuds not properly charged,Bass lavel zerobattary backup not satisfied",2
• Sound effects are good.    • Some times right earpiece battery drain fast before left earpiece.difference about 10% to 20%   • While calling person on the other side hear over noisy sounds from our surroundings which irritates them and make them feels uncomfortable.   • Feels ok with use of more than hours. But we don't able to understand what happens on surroundings due to earbuds isolates outside noise.,4
Good quality,5
Sound is nyç but.. perfectly not fit in ear,4
I love it,5
"Nice product, but the earbuds are very slippery from fingers. So they can be fall from them easily. The case is also not user friendly for easily opening. The whole design is slippery moulding.",4
It's sounds like real me buds 2 Not so fabulous But still bass is gd,4
Pros: Connectivity is greatAudio is greatCons:Box is so smooth that it slips away easily :(I used this for 15 days and no issues found other than the smoothness of the case.,3
i have been using it for almost 1 month. and it ia quite good in terms of price and specs ..i strongly recommend it.,5

"I think realme might have forgotten that the very basic use of ear pods is to talk. Music, battery , and design these all are secondary things. All I can say about this product is that, these earpods has the worst mic I have ever used. It won't pick ur voice if u are wearing mask. Don't buy",1

Totally horrible while talking on phone call..,1
"Every features are good in this device, but sometimes the device shows delay in pairing with other devices.",4
Connectivity is very bad. This earbuds good for listening songs . Battery backup is approximately 3-3.5 hours.build and design is very good but call quality is very bad. If you buy this buds for calling don't buy this buds . Calling quality and connectivity is very bad.,3
Bought it only rs1499. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is awesome.,5
Nyc product 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5

Best sound quality in this range,5
Nice,5
Most beautiful,5
👌 Excellent Product . Purchase Compulsory 🙏,5
Noise cancellation is a big issue.... during call the person on the other side will not able to hear anything if you are in crowded place or outdoor.,3
build quality it's not good it's feel cheep....but luck and sound is good,4
Sound quality was not so good.....,3
A best buy under this price segment. Definately go for it !,4
One bud gets stop working after 10 days from purchase this product....strictly avoid to look on this product other wise you will get regret like me,1
Okay. Sound quality is good EXCEPT for the bass. Treble and Mid tones are good.Huge problem is Latency Issue even with Low Latency Mode On. For non frequent music listeners it’s not a bad deal at this price point but for Gamers and People requiring a good bass it’s not recommended.,3
Best class...but sound a little bit can improve,5
Very very nice bass and also nice product,5
After one week sound is not coming from one side.,1
No remaining battery indicator,3
I'm really impressed by the product. In such a comfortable price they delivered the perfect product. Sound is pretty good and also you can make the call very comfortably. I had Sony Earbuds earlier which costed me Rs 14K. But I would say this realme Buds is way more better then the Sony one despite being cheap in price.,5
Not connect Bluetooth,1
Not bad simple sound good,4
One thing is very bad that is mic ...it is available in top of the air bird is should be towards down side for better audio,1

"*Sound quality is good*Clarity is good for this price *Battery back is good*Build quality of case is average*Magnet of case is not strong enough to hold the ear piece , which cause rattling sound on shakes.*Both ear pieces are free from blinking lights .*Light weight ear pieces feel comfortable and compact on ears.",4

"Purchased @ price of 1499. Compared to wired sony Xtra bass following observation. 1. Bass is good but not as much as sony but decent enough. Bass provided by sony earphones at 50-60% volume is provided by realme at sound level 80-90%.2. Battery is decent works for 2-3 hours for calling and loud music. 3. Build quality good doesn't feel itchy for longer use. 4. Box charger is B type, if it would have been C type would be awesome. 5. Light weight classic black look, premium build quality...",5

"Got it from Flipkart on offer on same day.. 5 ⭐ for that.. The sound quality is good for its size, Call quality is also good.. One issue is the buds are not in sync at times during calls, no issues during music.. Bluetooth range is bad, you lose signal the moment you go to next room. Amd also no dual pairing & connection, you can pair & connect only one device at a time..",3

Very good product ❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
Not compatible with lot of devices. And please don't trust the 7 day refund policy shown in flipkart it's a perfect scam ! Flipkart doesn't provide refund or replacement they just direct you to the company itself and it's left between you and realme service center. Worst experience on my first time with realme totally disappointed with flipkart ! Don't think about buying this product go for others like boat that provides better experience for this price range.,1

No problem at all from the buds, connects to my phone as soon as they are pulled out from the case, have a good battery backup of about 4 hrs. The sound quality is bass oriented, so the vocals are not that crisp, as some other earphones. Bass is absolutely badass, and it also has passive noise cancelation, along with a really snug fit. 1 thing i noticed was that it sometimes gets disconnected to my phone...",5

Super sound and good looking I like that prize,5
"Very much satisfied with the device at this price point being from an awesome brand. Design wise , I liked it more than rockerz 255 model.Bought the model blindly on its very first day with zero reviews and it was a wonderful choice I must say.Bluetooth 5.0 enables us to connect devices simultaneously. And vibration motor for calls , its too good.",5
"Nice headphone, bass was very good and sound is clear. I am purchase for calling purpose and best choice even riding on bike wear in one ear and opposite end voice was clear and no complaint for calling.. Battery backup 1 full day",5
Sound quality super battery backup super quality super this price range super and this value for money,5
"Wowwww it's amezing bluetooth nice look, nice price, nice battery back up, I love always flipkart product's and Flipkart replacement and refund policy, you can return or refund after received a demegzed product",5
Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.,4
"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet..",5
First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good.  I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.,4
This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup             2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please,1
It's a very good product ... I'm so happy with this BCz its bass quality & sounds is too good & batry back up Also super,5
Nice build quality.. bass is best it self.. vibrate at call is nice. .. nice support from flipkart and delivery partner,4
"After using for about 8 days, right side of the earphone is not working properly and the volume on right side is  very low. I didn't expect this.",1
Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning)  and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.,1
"Wow flip cart super fast service like  express speed delivery I order 11 am delivery At 5pm I am very happy,  boAt Bluetooth headset is very very excellent product fast charging super totally user friendly go for it",5
Very great product at this price I will assure that this is a value for money product and the bass and sound quality was awesome the build quality was great 👌 and this product has a mat finish which gives a class and flagship look this is the best and the fast charging technology was working very well and the ear are fixing suitable in our ear the music quality was great,5
It's very good and its bass is very high This bluetooth is very good best value or money but battery is too tiny.....Battery backup is not long time but it's realy fast charging support so little battery is comfortable with fast charging,4
"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" 😄😄😉",5
"This review is after 1 month of use .Pro:- 1.Battery backup is genuinely too good, runs almost 1.5 -2 days on a single charge.. and 8hrs on continuous playback.2. Charge very fast,,, 40% just in 15-20 minutes3. Sound is crisp,clear and decent, not too loud.  4. Build quality is awsome nd stylish as well.5.connectivity is super fast nd good with phones.6. Last but not the least,,, its really comfort able nd i didn't feel any discomfort or pain even after continous use of 5 hrs which i ...",5

"Hi Seekers, I am writing this review after 2 weeks of daily use, lets start with pros and cons Pros-✓Sounds Quality is good✓ Bass is good enough✓ Look is okay as per this price range ✓ All essential controls are provided✓ Backup is decentConsxx Bluetooth range is too short (even if you are walking by holding phone in your hand you will feel connection disturbances at all times)xx In case of battery get low it continuously gives you a voice signals in every 2 seconds I found its ver...",3
Great product.. I loved it.. As I was using level U.. This product is much more better than that.. Though battery life is just like 8hrs and bass like goosebumps... But when increased bass earplugs starts raddling.. Vibrate feature is awesome..,4
"Awesome product happy to have one.Good sound quality in medium volume, with equalizer app could complete the high bass sound. Battery last long 20 min of charge to enjoy whole day.Very light weight, Easy to carry,",4
It's a very good product... I'm so happy with this Bcz it's bass quality & sounds is too good & battery backup also superb,4
"Amazing product   Sound quality was awesome, it has deep bass which I really wanted, I am really satisfied and battery backup was also nice and it also had fast charging facilities",5
I think it is the best product in this price segment I buy this product after seeing it's sell figure and my decision got right u must buy this product I love it's sound quality but the build quality must be improved and they must give charging adaptor out of the box,4
Best product at this price loved it. Thank you flipkart for safe delivery 💯😃,5
Excellent voice clarity superb bass for music lovers. Overall a very good product.,4
"This earphone is just awsome yaar , everything is just so perfect yaar just go for it blindly ,i tell you u cant find a best product at this price its awsome👌👌👌👌",5
It is an amazing product.. For this price... Less weight.. Flexible.. Super sound... Extra feature is call vibration.. Nice one.. Try it..,5
The product was good enough.. Stylish blur color with well designed earphones.. Coming to the specifications sound and bass was superb... Value for money... Batery backup is also good around 6 hours life.... No lag in PUBG... Highly satisfied but have to wait and see how long it works like this,5
Boat headset is very clear voice and bass is v good and plus point is fast charging 20 mint to 4 hrs batery backup... One of the best bluetooth headset....osmmm products,5
"A fine product i would say , well crafted design and good build quality ..  good fit and comfortable to wear ... enough bass to provide u good sound experience .. although not the most premium quality but still considering the price it's well ahead of it .. manages lows and highs well, sound mixing and good listening experience when it comes to music video and others ..the only CON i noticed was the microphone .. i think this device is not built for calling ... sometimes the voice is not eve...",3
Good product very fast delivery (with in 36 hours only) superb color love it,5
Boat rockerz 235 v2 is the budget blutooth hearphone. All are very good performance only sound quality is slightly poor.. vibration and battery backup is the best part in this product. Bass also very great .. just lysric clearing not proper,4
If you are a bass lover then blindly go for it . And I think 8 hours of backup is enough and 4 hours charge in 20 mins .what else we want . Superb,5
"Review after about 2months of usage.Before starting let me be clear, THIS DEVICE IS NOT FOR SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS/AUDIOPHILES.I'm not gonna repeat the same technical aspects of it, you already know what's inside it. So...Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud. So no complaints there.If you've used some premium earphone from brands lik...",4
Im a jbl user ..boat 235v2 battery is too good to stay 2 days..fast charging..bass is 5 of 5 but sound of vocal is 4 of 5.. mic is good ..although i bought this in 1299 ..in this range its good,4
The boat 235v2 is really good it's sounds very clear and also good bass. If you think buy a Bluetooth headset go for It. Just sounds and battery backup is awesome.,5
"Above from my expectation, after reading the review i opted for not to purchase this product but guys you won't believe it really work, too good sound quality, superb bass overall it is lovelly one....will make ur day sweet.......bass lover will loved it.This boat 235v2 is better than boult pro bass product coz i ordered both the earphone jst as to compare the quality and boat rockerz is jst uncomaprable...perfect tune...superb acaustic....voice calling is far better that boult earphone........",4
I brought this product as I was looking for a sweat proof headset for my workouts. I got it for 899 and I have to say that am pretty satisfied with the features and the quality that the headset has to deliver. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. Just go for it !!!,5
Ti's is my first Bluetooth headset it is wonderful and color is more attractive and the sound quality is good and it is good product and value of money is 5star and battery is good,5
Very decent look product. Give superb bass. Mic quality is okok. Design and build is superb. In this price range it worth it.,4

Awsome Sound Quality 5 * !!Bass Is Awsome 5* !!Degin is Good 3* !!Battery backup much Good 4* !!,5
It so nice but nickband so tall but otherwise is best headphone call vibraion and fast charging nice product.....,5
It's a Awesome purchase. Value for money. I can't expect that type of sound and connectivity will get in this price range. Last time I bought Boult ear buds and refunded due to charging issue and connectivity issue.  That sound was not as powerful as this Boat headphone provides. Really happy to advise all of you if are searching for Bluetooth headphones please go for it. You will get everything you are searching for.  Thanks Flipcart. And request all of you please go for only Indian Products.,5
Very nice very satisfied and sound quality very good bass is excellent overall worth it,5
First of all it looks very perfect and is non fragile and awesome experience using this.....just fast delivery and well packed ....just perfect qs a product can be...and the best part is its mindblowing sound quality thunping my ears.....,5
"I think for this price range, it's one of the best available in market. sound quality is good and loudness is nothing short of excellence. Bluetooth connectivity is too good. Satisfactory with looks and build quality, could have been better.",5
i have ordered 2 headset reallyyyy awesome highly recommended for all good quality great supporting ear bud bass was veryyyy nyc,5
Perfect sound for the perfect priceI have been using it from three months everything is working good and best compare to another boat earphone. I just don't know why the company not issued any warranty for it.                          THANQ,4

"Best bluetooth headset in terms of bass, battery backup and fast charging,  this is only and only and only for listening songs, like while doing the workout ... but it is not meant for gaming and not even for watching videos cause I noticed a lot of lag,delay in delivering the audio,  if u want to play the games like pubg , pls dont go for it, and even the keypad tic tic sounds while typing are delayed for about a half a second , this headset is only for those people who ALWAYS LISTENS  TO mu...",4

Wow what a great product for in this price Fabulous sound quality and Aowsome battery backup I love this earphone and thanks Flipkart or boAt...,5
I would divide it in pros and cons...Pros:-1-good built quality2-excellent fit3-balanced sound4-good batery backup5- wireless range is good acc to price6-passive noise isolation is also acceptable7- Treible is good Cons:-1- Low bass#Others are good but it is good for a price at which I have got it i.e.899 more than this is not worthy for it,4
"Very sexy in look wise ... Awesome in this price range but boult audio curve is better option , good base and battery backup ..",4
It is good product i love it . Good sound quality and biuld quality. If you want to buy good headphones you ma try this👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯,5

Decent product and value for money. This is built with a very good design. The sound quality is medium and little low quality sound during calls and receiving calls. Not much of a bass sound quality effect. Overall a good product to go for in this price.,5
Good product battery backup was good and sound quality also good i loved it 😍,5
They are really amazing worth of money nd sounds good while hearing songs. I'm satisfied with the product too much ?. Thank you...,5
"Sound for listening music is sufficient and balanced sound for light user, bass is normal not a very high bass. Having distorted while making a call. But also a positive sign that is a battery backup, company provides 8hr battery backup and that's true, battery backup is very good at this price. Overall at this budget price range this boat 235v2 Bluetooth Headphone is good and value for money.",3
Superb Product Awesome bass Awesome battery backup & fast charging excellent Bluetooth connectivity All over 5/5.....👌,5
sound quality is good. but earbuds are a bit rough.but ok. bass is good. build quality is what I like the most. battery backup is also nice. overall a good product. worth for your money delivery is a bit late and could be fast,4
"The Boat rockerz 235v2 is really a good wireless earphone,The build quality is awesome 👌👍The bass is very good and the most interesting part of this device is the call vibration.Thankyou boat for this good features.",3

Good product at this prize good sound good base must buy,5
"Not so comfortable to wear and ear started paining after 5 min of use and music is not so clear we feel like hearing a radio,",1
Almost all good bass ok not more then JBL and real me but ok soft bass like it and one more thing headset earbuds  not nice not comfort to listen long time just for 30mins ok and not comfortable with earsbuds  design not nice boat 255 is the best design earbuds overall i will give rate for boat Rocker 235v2 ( 8/10 rating),3
"I got this earphone right now everything was ok but when i plugged in charging led light was not working it was really low when i saw it properly , I don't know if this is with my piece only or led is low .",3
The earphones are very good if you are looking at buying one for listening to music. Please look for other options if you intend to make calls as well. The microphone is not great and the person on the other side of the call will not be able to hear you clearly,2
"Some times buttons not workingSome times incoming call voice not activating we need to disconnect and reconnect again..Battery is excellent almost 3days backup for callsCharging very fast few minutes onlyBass level and sound clarity is good. Vibration while call waiting is irritating, not need this future Finally i will give only ⭐⭐ for this product.",2
"Brilliant earphones,,    With extraordinary battery backup. I didn't expect this much.  Supremely tuned sound. Hifi bass.     Balanced stereo sound. Go for it.                           Thank you.",5
"Sound is really good seeing the price range..I got it for 899/-, so happy with the quality. Previously using Mivi Thunderbeats with 13mm drivers, so it now feels a little low in sound now..bt if u see the price(at 899) its a good package. Bt yes I noticed the call quality is not so good. The other person on the call can't hear my every word properly. Using Boat Basshead wired also, bt this prblm is not there with that.",4
Everything good i order same product just because of quality and backup and best fitting everything is nice and also good sound quality in this budget thanks flipkart,4
"This is my first neckband earphone, i am really surprised for this product and truly happy good quality, nice sound and build quality is very well.. Really happy 😊",4
It's works fine and superb with this budget. Only thing is it will not compatible for PUBG game you will get the sound later for every action. Ex. You get the enemies foots sound after arrival means later.,4
I bought it for my mom and it's good.....well just good nothing more there are some issues but they can be neglected considering the price so if someone is on a tight budget then this is good or else I will recommend to go for oneplus bullets z earphone they are far better than these.,5
Beat product for normal people for class office work and song streaming ....Sound quality osm : no vibration or cracks with highest volume also...Battery back up good : with morning 100% charge last till night on continues useing ... Experience of 3 months ...Hardware : has been fallen from 4 to 5 feet 3 to 4 times all is fine Vibration : the vibration when we get call the band near the neck vibrates not so harsh so it's goood Best part : connects 2 device at a time which will help ...,5
Awesome product. Value for money. Good sound quality with better bass. Best thing is battery backup it last up to 12 to 14 hrs in single charge. Surely suggested......👍,4
"Good quality sound output from the earphones. Battery backup is good as per product specification do meets the exact backup time. Reacharge also won't take much time. Only thing I found little bit bad was the thin wires used. If you are a tough user go for flat wired type boat models, this one could break if not used safely and softly. Good product.",4
"Good product,  I liked ,decent sound quality, good battery backup. Charging port is not in proper place  it should have been in different place. Call  quality is good. Thanks Flipkart",4
Very good headset with very good sound quality and charging is very fastOnly thing is that the support for ear plugs can be made little bit more comfortableOverall a very good product.,4
Ear buds not comfort to ears.last call memory is there.next song forward is not there.we can't skip present song to go next song.very good blue tooth set for that price.very fast charging.charging cable.is given. charging adopter not given. over-all one should buy this.buy and enjoy .triple sound s are not effective.,4

"I have purchased it in 899. After using 3 days I am writing this review.  It has very good battery backup. In 10 min charge you can used it for 2.5 hr. Sound quality is good. It has good bass as well. Previously I was using boat 255 and it has better bass and design as well. The issue in it the connectivity is not much good.

Although it's too early to write a review after just one day of use but I was using skullcandy method for two years but due to support local manufacturer this time I decided to purchase these earphones and believe me it's way more better than any other so called established brands. Sound and Bass are next level cool Bettery back up is also goodVibration during incoming call is a feature which was missing in skullcandy method which was 3200 while it's cost is 864(During sale).,4
"It's not too good , When I play any song fast I hear a sound like ""kachh"" sound quality is not good",3

"Sound quality not that good. Can't play it in full volume. Boat rockers 255 is way better than this product. I would definitely not recommend this earphone as if u add some 300rs to this price you can go for boat rockers 255. Avoid buying this, it's not worth ot",2
Nice...This is my first wireless handfree as per expectations Nice one  Design  is good but finishing is rough Bass is not to Good but okey  everg Calling is good i'm HappyDelivery was also Nice before Due date deliveredThanks Flipkart..Overall good purchase in this price range..,4

I used with full charge its run a full day... I am soo happy with battery backup... And vibration mood is superb... ... Don't thik just buy it....,5
Battery backup and build quality is good. Look wise also good. Fitted well in ear. But not happy with sound quality of song. You will need to install seprate equalizer application for better sound .,4
I love it specially because of battery backup.. sound quality is actually good but if you looking at it for calling purpose only so don't buy it. Noise cancelling doesn't work properly in these earphones others wise very nice product for those who love watching movies for hours and play games too,5
Must buy bluetooth headset. Guys blindly go for this headset. Very very worthy. It looks like more premium and got good design. It looks more premium than 255 F model. The most important thing in this headset is adjustable wire strap.,5
Review after 20 days of use.First of all bass is good if you love bass then go for it without second thought.Lags in build department as wires are thin.Have magnetic buds with no functionality i don't know why they provided.Connectivity is good i can hear music from one room to other without much distortion.If you are buying for general use like music and stuff then it's okay but for gamers or i say pubg players then you will be disappointed becoz they are just bad in that department the...,4
Good Quality i use this everyday but its design is have to like Samsung's level U product. Otherwise its sound quality is awesome in this price level.,5

Connecting wires feel fragile not for very rough use. ...,4
"To be frank it's not up to what i expected.... i have been using boat 900 for last couple of years... May be because it is wired one, the quality of audio is very good in 900..... But in this Bluetooth one it's not that great.... But still according to the price it is a good deal. Battery back up is good and the build quality is nice......",4
Good packing and fast delivery light weight good quality at best price,5
It's really nice earphone it's looking good and it's better backup wass asmon it's good l bought it is 900 in that price was no compuition rally nice,4

"Great earphones in this price range with very great features like sweat proof, vibration call alert. Build quality is good overall good product",5
"It's bang for your buck , pretty good earphones , it has got good bass by default but if you're a bass lover then you would just need to tweek some settings in equaliser.",4
I just loved it because it's under best budget and good sound quality build quality little bit better overall performance of this headphone great.,5
Using it for few days. Really nice product. Pros:1. Superb build quality and comfortable.2. Excellent sound quality with a bit heavy bass.3. Good battery backup and fast charging.4. Call (Both ph and whatsapp) quality is also good.Cons:1. Connection gets weaker after ~20 ft.2. Answering/Rejecting whatsapp call doesn't work.,5
Excellent overall sound quaLity. Very good product with very good features. Recommended for everyone.,5
"Bought this pretty decent Headset about a month ago.Here are the pros: Good sound quality and bass, Bluetooth 5.0 with easy connectivity, Water proof and sweat proof. Cons: The wires are pretty thin and fragile. Should take extreme care. If you're a rough user, you might wanna rethink on buying this.Overall a good headset at decent price... So far so good.",4
"It is my first purchase for wireless Bluetooth, it is cool.. I  was looking for sound feature which it has awesome sound and cool headset. Fully satisfied with product.",5
"Super sound clarity and really good quality deep bass,and very fast charging.Thanks flipcart for quality product.",5
"Good looks, light weight, value for money.Pros Good battery back, up to 8hrs and above if charged proper for 2hrs.Sound quality is very good for music, calls quality also good, Cons Bass heavy, Ok on medium sound,,Wires quite thin should have been little thick",4
Wires connected to the earbuds are very thin...it would be great if the wires used were thick. Otherwise it is great experience to use it...looks far better than boat rockerz 255f as it is very outdated now.,4
"Nice design, build quality & nice colour. Good sound quality, bass and nice Call mic quality. I loved the product. Best Bluetooth earphones in this price range",5
Fastest deliver ( i recieved the product in the next day ) & amazing product with good sound clarity. Great battery backup,5
"Nice one at this prise range ,and it's good i got this at 860 rupees , we can connect 2 phones at a time ,mic quality is awesome ,bass is amazing",4
Flipkart delivery was fast and product was good but I ordered blue colur I got black. Everything else was good. Go for it very good headphones in this price value for money,5
"I got it for 899rs. According to this price the product Is pretty good, sound quality is average  but the earlocks are pretty painfull if you wear it for too long over all  it's good product for this price range.i bought this because of quick charging which work really well and save your time.",3
It's such a nice product in this valuable price... Just loved it seriously don't think too much guys just go for it.....,5
Excellent.. my 1st bluetooth Headset & m very much Happy with it.. 999/- is the best cost for this headset..Truly worth it..,5
"i got the headset today. just dhamaka pack device.. sound quality, bass boosted, design awasome.. fast connect to  mobile. very comfortable item. now i am new fan of boat headset.. now let see how much it durable.. i liked it💓",5
"This product it means it amazing , seriously its superb , sound or bass yr outstanding or awesome , i think u should going for buy this without any doubts , I personally really ❤️ it 👌👌",5
It is so good in awesome product I am so happy e this product battery backup he is good,5
Just go for it.... u cant purchase better wireless earphone at this range....its sound quality is not so good on watching you tube video but it is fabulous when i listend it from Wynk music app with changing in equalizer....i recommend u to listen songs on this on ur music app....it is far better.,5
"Guys, today I got my order. The sound quality and the bass is awesome. but don't buy this for PubG as you get latency. you will hear after 2 - 3 secs of firing, footsteps, and messages. So, for music and calls its pretty good but for gaming don't buy this. Go for 255F for PUBg.",4
Good product. But if u want for playing PUBG ITS NOT GOOD TOO MUCH AUDIO DELAY. I TRY LOTS OF THINGS TO FIX BUT . ITS DIDN'T WORK. FOR MUSIC AND CALLS ITS GOOD BUT FOR PUBG I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT ONE.,5
Delivery of product in one day and product quality also good I loved it thank Flipkart for ur commitment delivered in one day,4
"I bought this blue colored awesome headphone only at 899 during the pandemic time.Before I say about the product, I would I like to add a special thanks to flipkart and ekart delivery boy who helped me and supported me in change to delivery address and gave it to me safely.NowAbout the product its a really nice product at this price, sound and bass quality is quite impressive and battery backup is more than 8hrs.I just received it by today, so will give further review after a month.",5
"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good.",5
The best earohones so far. The buil quality is little cheap but it won't feel that much... Sound quality is good and bass is alsoo good .. overall worth the price.,4
Great headset With mind blowing bass and decent sound...Nervous abt the built quality finishing is not too good but still i enjoy the music overall this is the best product i suggest to purchase...,5
It's good right now. Working good. Happy using it. Use it for taking online classes and yoga and it's just working beautifully.,4
It's nice product & good sound & good base                    Designed is super and smooth control tqs flipkart,5
"Everything is fine about this product except the wire quality. Its not bad, bt can be improved.Otherwise best if you see price wise",4
"Very good for average users who are not looking for deep bass. Battery life is decent and charge time is quick.A few times there is some sort of connection problems and the headset keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, but it happens only once or twice in 2 to 3 days so nothing to worry about.Also while answering calls sometimes though the headset is connected you wont be able to answer and the inbuilt vibrator wont stop even after answering the call through your phone.Nice mids and averag...",4
Awesome product it is very useful to taking call while on drive and good designed for wire strip come with this is good to see totally worthy to purchase,4
The best product in this price range. I mean what more can you expect from a product @899/- only.Sound quality is average. Clarity is not good. However bass is good. Battery backup and fast charging is awesome.,5
"Good Design , Good Build Quality , Battery Backup is also Good & Works Properly",5
Awesome product I used so many headsets but I feel good nice product vibration alert is nice I buy this in sale for 899Rs,4

"Posting this review after use of one day. The build quality of this product is very good, quality of material is great. Big battery backup as claimed by the company so for build quality n battery backup 5 out of 5. But if we compare sound quality then i qm quite disappointed. My local earphones giving nice sound than this, for me sound quality should have been more better than this, i wanted to return this product but there is no option of cash refund and now have to bear loss for this. I sho...",3
"Pretty Happy with the Bass and Lowest price range.Actually it is far better than the higher version of rockers itself in the design aspect.also it offers a decent sound quality.Don't compare it with headphones of 2k price range.If you are not happy in spending more than 1k then go for it.It delivers good sound quality in voice calling also,and Mic is decent.It will never disappoint you.",5
"best in market..superb quality and very good battery backup,235v2 boat is much better than other boat Bluetooth..sound is superb",4
Best in budget best in bass vocals treble...got it at 850/-  in offer gud battery backup lasts up to 6 to 7 hrs based on volume and fast charging is an top edge thing to this product without any dout go for it writing this review after using it for a week countinuesly and call quality is superb,5
Pros.1) bass is good 2) design is very good and build quality is also very nice3)ear fiting is really really good4)can connect to 2 devicesCons.1) connectivity is fast but audio lag is there.     A real noticeable gap that can make video different.2) connectivity is fast but sometimes showing connected but doesn't playing audio in earphone.3) treble is low and bass is high so sometimes in some song you will feel need of treble .Conclusion:-A good earphone with very sleek design a...,4
"These earphones are really amazing and worth buying. .. only for those who loves playing song , movies or for gym purpose ... Those who wants to buy it for pubg .. i request u not to buy... Because sound comes after the gun shut.. sound delayed by some mini seconds.. not exactly when u fire..Otherwise it will be perfect 🤩And also thanks Flipkart",5
That earphones are amazing bass are very powerful and good sound quality........ love you boat...and love you flipkart.,5
DELIVERY IS GOOD IN BEFO ON TIME THANK U FLIPKART. PRODUCT IS AMAZING LOVE IT,5
This is amazing compact product  and sound quality is too good  when compared to boat 255f or audio curve this is flagship... Verry good Battery for 15min or charge it will be like 80% just go for it....!!!,5
"Sound and bass is undoubtedly awesome in this price range.Battery performance is very good hence m using this from 1 week.Mic performance is fine while callingBuild quality is also good, it's light weight... The earplug cable could be a little better, I mean qualiry wise.Overall a very good product",4
"Overall is Good at this price , super base quality super battery backup but built quality not super but okay at this price, boat working very well.",5
"I got surprised after listening through it.Awesome bass, with good look and magnetic slit.You will feel like you are in front a dj and your legs will automatically start moving on the beat.Guy,s don't hesitate, just go for it.You will never find a product like this.Just Rs.999 with fully loaded features.",5
Overall it' s good product however when you using continuously your ear starts paining n ear grip is also not good which I felt ...otherwise it's a good product.,4
"Excellent product sounds quality is very good , bass 🔊 is perfect thank you flipkart",5
"Superbly amazing in just 899 (1199).. perfect sound, totally it's all great experience",5
"Best product under 1000 ! sound quality is clear as well as good looking, easy to use and remove ,overall nice product .",5
The earphones look decent and have average built quality.They do produce good bass but the clarity is sort of average.Overall I would say spend 200 or 300 more and get the Boat Rockerz 255 or JBL inifinity.,4
Its a great product from boat. You should go for it. Its amazing in this price. I Love it,5
I using boult Curve for last 8 months and his sound was awesome and connectivity is very poor and this boat 235v2 connectivity is awesome and fast charging is cool,4

Microphone of this Bluetooth headset is problematic. When we receive call person talking with us can't hear properly. And tha game is started of hello hello and hello...Faulty headset given by boAt..Replace it now only.,1
I own both the boat rockers 235 and boAt 235v2 and I can say that the sound quality of 235v2 is soft and clear but it lacks the punch that boat rockers 235 has. Morever it is a bit heavier then the boat rockers 235 making it little uncomfortable for a long use. Better Is however exceptionally good. The range is not taht much of a improvement and the most annoying thing I experienced is that it gets disconnected very quick and most of time when I connect it with my laptop will only connect and...,1
So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)The...,4
Its an awesome product.But if you are going for this to play games then you must not. It gets a sound delay.Overall its sound quality is immersive.Microphone need to be improved. The voice sound gets reduced when in call.,3
Overall okay in this price range. I got it for Rs864. Call vibration is plus point.,5
Earlier I gave 5 star rating to this product but after using few days it stopped working . Don't purchase total waste of money..,1

"Writing this Review after 23 days of use. 1. Battery backup is off the charts. They say 8 hours and they give it. 2.Quick charge. I've never charged it for more than 30 minutes and it stays live whole day. 3. Sound quality is good, not the best. 4. Latency is there. So if you're planning to play online games like COD Or PUBG it'll get you killed. Expect a minimum 1 second delay.5. Phone calls won't be private anymore, you'll need to speak louder than usual in order to make conversations ...",5
Sound is good. Battery backup is amazing. Got it for 999. Satisfied. Design can be improved.,5

"I got this product for 865 rs. In this price i feel it offers quite turbulent sound quality. You can compare this profuct to other competitors of around 1000rs. Or so.Pros: good battery backup, good sound quality overall, satisfsctory bass, good build quality for the price, light weight completely no issue in wearing for longer hours.Cons. Highs n treble bit on d average side.Anybody who is on a budget of less than 1000 rs. N looking a bluetooth option can surely opt for it.",4

"One side is not working after 15 days... Not expected so low sound quality from boAt..Product is very worst, don't go for it.",1
Worse product mic not working.,1
Very poor product. None of the buttons are working except the function of powering on. Even it's unable to power off also.,1
"I was happy with the purchase at a price of 899. But, completely disappointed as it started misbehaving from day 3 onwards. The MFB and other two buttons stopped working most of the times. Didn't even allow the user to turn off the set. Claimed for guarantee and waiting for replacement for the last 1.5 weeks. Do think before purchase.",1
"They cheated a lot, they got worse in less than a month with Bluetooth",1
It is getting disconnected frequently. Not satisfied with this product.,1
Too bad product. Volume buttons are not working properly. Don't buy this,2
"Stopped working 2 days after the return period ended for me, Headset is very inferior in quality, Lost faith in Boat product quality ..",1
Waste productIt seems to be worst at battery and microphoneIt would be shutdowns at a 40_30 % of charging,1
Bluetooth Connection is worst.. Signal gets cut if you go 2-3 meter from the phone.. Gets disconnected often.. Rest is manageable..,1
every time i have to remove this device from Bluetooth list and reconnect to the laptop.. otherwise earphones are not working. and the problem is only with this headset.. other companies headsets are working properly with my laptop,1
Worst product i ever purchased from Flipkart.On the second day it started disfunctioningThe buttons was disfunctioning.automatically the track were playing.the headset won't trun off. Totally disappointed with this product.,1
BoAt is awesome I am use boAt 228 wired earphoneAfter I was parched boAt 235v2 bluetooth headset Shortly i say best performance only boAt company earphones.Hum to diwane ho gayeAap bhi ho jaaaaaooo.....Best for movieBest for ultra hd soundBest for gaming (PUBG LOVERS)☺️☺️☺️👍👍👍👍👍,5
Battery pickup bed,3
product is good but .. courier service is very very bad,1
I have purchased this blutooth earphone for my laptop and mobile together. It can pair with boath at a time and no need to switch one device to another.I am having mic issue (the person i called getting my voice very low) when connected to moto g6 and moto e 3 power mobile but with other brand phone like vivo v9 it's working properly.,4
Good product best price...864/-,5
"Every thing is good,but I think there is no option to change the song through physical button, I think this function is missing in this earphone. For that I'm giving it 4 Rating.",4
im giving a review in using after 4 months it's automatically disconnected and charging port was damaged  totally waste of money,1
"Bad product,  if you change next song and press + button  but its not work.  Song not paused.  Boat is bad product.",1
"Boat Rockerz 235 V2 is Super Bluetooth Neckband Headphone....I like Boat Bluetooth headphones...Design : 09/10Bass: 10/10Bluetooth connectivity: 09/10Battery Backup: 09/10 (8 Hours super)Call voice clearity: 08/10 (Good)Overall : 09/10From: Manjunatha Hugar, Davanagere.",5
Best if u get it under 1499/.,4
Connectivity is poor...3 metres distance.... sounds cutting starts,2
"I got this headset on 22 Jul 2020 and on 04 July 2020 just after 14 days after purchase it stopped working, a crank sound came while listening music, it almost sounded like IC blasted and then it stopped working, not charging at all, BOAT plz respond, worst piece of head set dont waste your money",1
Fits snuggly in the earsEasy to useVery flexible,5
This is such an amazing headsets... But i shop it for pubg gaming and for gaming it's useless... There is a huge sound lag between sceen on going and audio receiving.. that's why I'm giving 3 stars,3
But distance  frequency  problem,1
"My first bluetooth headset I am satisfied, Sound is Mind-blowing with bass & Battery backup is good & this price best in Market",5
Really great sound from the earphones. Also very good built quality. Really loved the product.,5
After 3 months real plus r not working properly my friends have 2 from Flipkart this product and they said after 2 week ok my I have take two piece for my family and both are not working properly ear plug cables are not so good don't take this product because product is having issue for everyone same issue is there we can't hear the voice don't buy this product this is my personal and my friends sad Me waste of money is this please don't buy 😓🤧🙏,1
Best,5
Nice,5
Product is good. I got It for Rs 999/-. As of now I am giving 3 stars for following reasons. The radius area for blue tooth connectivity is only 6 meters not 10 meters as they claim. Secondly the ear phone cables are very short and thin which makes you to feel uncomfortable when you wear. boAt needs to improve the design.,3
Worst products ever seen Please don't buy.It is having low built quality.Not at all water proof.Not even 5 meter rangeIt's true review I have returned it in 4 days.Please don't buy,1

"Very good option at this pricePros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below) Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players.",4
"I hope you guys find this review helpful, well it's too soon for a review but I think it's worth every penny, Sound - Do not have high expectations for bass atleast, rest of the sound is amazing, you get a clear voice even if it turns a bit windy on roads, songs when played have a clear voice, good for casual song listening, you can watch movies and browse, sound is good even when you play games on phone.Battery backup - is amazing, I've been using it the whole day, as soon as you put the...",5
This price segment this is pretty good and love this boat product and sound quality is average bad battery backup is super I love this airdops,5
Bass is not upto the mark. Sound quality is excellent. Cryastal clear sound. Boat should improve the bass quality in this airdopes. Boats other headphones having best bass .overall it's good and value for money.,4
Loved the sound quality loved the base and the bild quality is awesome 👍👍👍👍 I love it plzzz go for it best airpods in this price buy it right now n for pubg also best it is 🔥🔥👍👍,5
"I ordered the product in the sale on 22nd Aug & immediately received it on the morning of 23rd Aug.I must say at this price point the product is quite good. Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.Rest as of now is great. Time shall tell how great this product is.",4
Although design is gud in look but the sound quality is cheapest...not only cheapest...its too cheapest and annoying...😣Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate... 👎👎👎I have boat eardopes 281 which is also very good in sound and design...,1
"Worth a single penny 👍👍, big thumbs up.I am simply giving 5 star rating, it exceeds my expectations,  those who is thinking to get something in affordable range,this airdopes are made for them only 👍 .I ordered this on first sale , though I wanted to order Black color, but black was out of stock so I have to order this color which looks elegant as well. After using for a day I am writing this, this is worth to buy , don't think too much just go for it, according to price nothing is com...",5
Good product with fine looks. Bass is not super good but it is ok u can feel beats.connectivity is good overall product is good but one thing hurts me is that it is not waterproof 😭 and this is a issue for me rest I am happy because it's design is pretty cool . I had  already one plus wireless earphone but whenever I use it it's neck wire irritates me😂,4
"Yeah the Airdopes are cool , 1299 is very good price and overall I'll give it 4 starsPros:1. Easy connectivity2. Sleek and good looking design3. Very good battery backup4. Case and earbuds both are madhe of high quality plasticCons:1.There is a slight 1 second delay when music is played most of you won't notice but i noticed it while playing games.2. Ears hurt while pressing the multi functional button , touch controls could have been better3. Base is not as high as what i expected f...",4
First thanks to flipkart for super fast delivery.Boat has brought great airdopes in such a affordable price.Sound quality is good .Light weight .Good colors.Bass could have been better.Overall great product from Made in India Brand Boat.,5
"Battery backup awesome...5*Bass 3* Sound 4.5*Design build 5*Lags in game audio ... Good for movies and songs ..... single earphone use feature is good... battery backup awesome , I m using for 3 hours its just 70% ...n the case is Full charged separately.....Overall in 1299 I would recommend it only if u r ready to compromise with bass ...Overall 4* ...",5
"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once  and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price,  THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkart😍😍",5
Thank you flipkart for the fastest delivery got this airdopes delivered within 24 hrs ....  I have been fan of boat from past 3 years and I have been using boat rockerz bluetooth earphones and then I ordered this one amazing one in this price point ...Waiting for the another sale so that I can order one more ....Thumbs Up👍Must buy product ❤️,4
"Not at all for bass lover. The music just seems to be soft nor is it loud, there's no loudness at all. According to the price it should've been a bit more worth it building up the bass & for bass lovers there's no bass at all. Giving an honest review from the day of purchase & delivered.",1
"I never bought any kind of Bluetooth pairs, this was my first purchase and I can say this was the best purchase at this segment. The quality of the product and music is outstanding and I never expected that to in this price. Thank you, Flipkart for the express delivery which you offered.",5
"Worth buying, great product in this price, looking stylish, I like one feature in this we can also connect one earbud with one phone and 2nd with another phone, so that 2 people can use this with different device.",5
I think it is worth....Sound :- Sound quality is good but sometime music is stop for mili sec...btw in this price range no company provide like this...Build quality :-is good but the blue blinking light irritate me and beacuse of blue light it looks cheap...Battery :- good battery backup ...no problem,5
Best product you can buy in this price range. Sound quality is good and connecting speed is really fast and battery backup is also good.,5
"Worst product ever bought. Instead, you can go and try for ""Flipkart smartbuy bass beatz"". A very decent earphones in very reasonable price. Never go for boat airdopes 131 as this is just good in look and WORST in performance. Could have given 0 star if available in option.",1
Fabulous in this range.. 1. Sound quality is very good2. Premium built quality and look.. from inside it may feel like plastic3. Battery backup is good..4. If you love bass the don't go for it..5. It doesn't block your ear.. you can hear surrounding voice while using it,4
Nice colour nd too cute sound quality is good hope it works well,5
Premium design + comfortable fit + awesome funky colours + universal compatibility with bluetooth enabled devices + great price + flipkart trust + vocals clarity + instrumental separation clear even at low volume +  value for money ...Love my own latest pink boat airdope 131...😍,5
"It's nice overall mainly because of the low price. It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music. The bass is not upto the mark. Call quality is nice. But what else you need for such low cost. Good for those who don't like in-ear silicone earphones.",5
Boat is just super noone can beat ....in this range best earpods .... battery is super and sound is terrificFast delivery by Flipkart thanks,5
Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.,5
"It is definitely a good purchase at this price, those who don't care for loud bass and thing, they can go for this, these Airdopes are perfectly balanced in terms of sound, the sound doesn't breaks at high volumes, you can still enjoy your songs smoothly. The normal calling with this works perfectly, no as such issues there, but you may find bit issues on WhatsApp calls, as voice tends to break sometimes. You can use one airdope at a time and it works perfectly.Lastly, the battery backup, i...",5
Good for the priceSound if loud and clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is good. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.,4
Nice headsets. Great sound quality. Finest design.Will be better if bass also gets improved.overall nice and best @ this price range👌,4
"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven’t used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy.",4
"I wish to point out one very basic thing the earbuds are designed well but the material used for covering the sound outlet is no good it in good brands its steel or metal based very fine mesh, in this case it  just came out to be nothing but a cloth based thin layer pasted with low quality glue. Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore.",3
Awesome product with this price range. Nice build quality and very comfortable for long duration use. Impressed with the battery backup. Go for it.😊👍,5
Don't expect bass... decent audio quality not so great ... Good for calls and mic works well ..fits perfectly in ear but continues usuage will get pain in ears as the size is little bigOverall value for money product,3
Super good build quality price is better than other brands I'm fully satisfied thank you boAt,5
"So actually these are very impressive at such low price. Boat has been always knows for delivering great sound. Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy. Haven't tested the backup but I believe it will pass that too.♥️The sound part is actually a bit heavy and not so c...",5
"Some People mentioned that it had a bad bass. But its an excellent product, worthy to your money. Excellent sound and bass. batteruly Backup is good too.And also you can't expect apple airpods in such range of 1299Rs.",5
"The best in class airdopes. Great sound, perfect fit and at this price it's just awesome. Highly recommended.The only issue is that Boat has mentioned additional earmuffs with the package but it is not available in the box or it is missing.",5
Mind blowing parches. Very nice headset in low budget. Go for it. I think this is the best in this price range. I ordered on 22 August and got it on 23 August. Very fast delivery. Thanks flipkart.,5
"I using these Headset for last 2 days. The experience with my Boat Airpods 131 Bluetooth Headset is nice. But the price (Rs-1,299)of the product  is very costly. We can expect many things for these price from other brand. When we come with brand we want to sacrifice the price.Probs:1) Very good design and build for these prize2) Bluetooth connectivity is Awesome3) Type - C Port for charging the headset is good.4) 1 year warranty5) Battery backup is upto the markCons:1) Bass of the ear...",5
"This product sound quality and comfort is good, fit very well in my ears.Connection gets interrupted when moving to another room, so connection range isn't  great, just Okay.It's my first airdopes, got them for 1274/- and overall recommended for this price.",4
"Comfortable fit, looks good, sound quality is satisfactory above average, built quality is average, connectivity/pairing is easy,Battery performance can't predict in two day of usage of this product Overall Decent product at this point of price for a TWSIF THE BUDGET IS LOW THEN ITS A GREAT BUY",4
"This is good only... If your looking for fast beat with high bass, then don't go with this product. Else go for it and it will be worth for amount.",4
1. Attractive price2. Timely delivered3. Built quality is good4. Sound quality is good5. Bass is poor6. Battery backup ( Stand-by) - 12 hrs                                (Continuously played) - 8 hrs7. Fast connectivity8. Comfortable on ears.,5
If You really want to use a wireless airpod at this Budget you can definitely go for it... The Sound Quality is very good with low bass.! One thing I dont like about the product is the continuous flickering of the blue light in the ear. Overall a product worth for 1300/-,4
"Sound quality is above average and bass is low , design and look is amazing. At this price range it is a great deal . If you are a good music lover do not go for this, for call purposes it is good.",4
Got the device in 2 days.Fast delivery by flipkart.Sound quality is the best at this price range.Even better than realme buds air and other like mivi.Best package at 1299.Must buy,5
"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it. 3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",5
Excellent product under such a tight budget...Overall great experience till nowHowever the left earphone gets discharged earlier everytime than the right one even if I overcharge the left one separately or in pairGives a continuous playback of 3.5 hrs microphone is also awesome5 star for the product,5
"Fabulous just can say this word only. Awesome design, awesome fitting and loved the Voice ..  A+",5
"Perfectly best !! 🤩•Cool design, comfortable fit•Good battery backup•Good sound 🎶•Less sound delay•Value for money 💸#.Some negative points 😡 :•Almost no bass  🔊❌•Not waterproof   💦❌But, I'm really satisfied with the product.I got my dream earbuds at a best price.I bought it after returning another product (unigen unipods) twice...!!",5
Good headphonesSound quality is so best I like the headphones and also delivery is so fast,5
Good for music lover and Airpods lover but not for gaming becaus of don't have low letacy transfer rate is normal like bluetooth devices.Battery backup good like 3 to 4 hours and with case approx used for 3 days on one time charge.,4
Nice products if you have wish to  buy a airdopes you can try this product overall products is good bass is not bed and quality of sound is not like a earphone but good,5
Good quality good sound quality nice product good value good service quality,4
"Liked the product. However, this one is not for the music lover. But for general use, its amazing. Battery life cant say much as its too early. The best thing is it matches my bedroom wall...well be a little cautious with the colors they are not exactly how it is shown in the pics. Mine turned more towards baby pink...",5

Horrible experience from the boat service customer care team. The item stopped working after two weeks of usage and not yet replaced/ rectified by the boat company even with one year warranty. Worst experience ever. Not accepting flipkart bill for warranty saying that provide original bill.,1
At this price you can't expect more than that is being offered.,5
Very Cheap quality... 😔😔😔😔Buttons are very cheap and very tight on press . Body look is very cheap...  too much disappointed..   and flipkart tracking service is very poor..Flipkart never tell the right Tracking status of our product.. i was unable to track my order since 3 days 😥😥😓😓,1

"Sound Quality is good, but battery is so bad. When 70% of battery remaining, left ear pods is totally shut down, and only I can here right ear. Is really embarrassing & my site product is very bad for this situation.",1
Excellent battery backup superb design worthble,5
Sound and bass quality are good. But because of the design it hurts a lot in the ear.,4
Best Product Best sound and Bass qualityNice design and worth the moneyGood battery backupFast Delivery and thanks to flipkart...,5
It's good in this price range.... Not heavy bass booster but it's good.,4
Near to one month usage I am rating thing. Product is very good for this money. Bass little bit less. But for me one side battery is getting drained so fast. But I love the product 😻,4
My 40 rs local headphone is better than this comparing to bass quality😈🤬,2
Does'nt fit ear poor bass quality poor sound as well as battrey backup is too low...I would rate this product 1/5,1
Good and comfortable.base is not good it's best in this price,4
"*Battery backup is best,* sound quality is best * soft sound quality * equaliser is great",5
All good but highly disappointed with bass,4
For good bass.. go to setting customize the bass quality..,5
Honest review:-. Have have been using for a 2 weeks now this product is not charging at all what can i say more .Dont waste your hard earned cash .Cheap products always pay you back with cheap quality.Now i have done with it.Trash and nothing else.,1
"ProsPerfect Fit in ear Excellent battery back upGood designCheaper in the market Calling experience - I could hear the other person on the phone, crystal clear.ConsMusic & bas are just ok not wow level.. but still not badNot able to pick the earpod from the case very easily it's bit annoying.. and also slippery to remove from the case.On call The other person complains that the voice is bit robotic",4
I am happy with what I received.,4
"I have apple Airpod too. But this 1 is good looking than that.compact , small . But no bass, if you want to talk over it then definitely go for it. If you want to listen music than this is not your cup of tea.",5
love this..very reasonable price but good quality,5
Nice Product sound quality is very nice and design is not bad it is not near ear it is lost you any time it is not perfect in ear,5
Design and sound quality is very good. Worth of money.😀,4

"Build quality chorom, fit osm, Battery nice but sounds normal.",5
"It is decent only for listening to music. If you are using it for calls then this wont work well. There are 2 big problems with this. First, there is a 2-3 second delay from when you speak to when the other person hears you. This lag is somtimes there when watching videos too. Second, the mic isn't good. You need to talk very loudly for the mic to pick up what you're saying.",2
Plz dont buy from flipkart horrible experience .. if it nt get fit in ear there is no refund from boat ... Poor app poor manufacture.... Plz guys dont buy this i m telling.... mike is also poor ...

Great,5
Nice..best in this price,5
Mic poor connection,3
Noise cancellation is the worst...I would have given 4 or 5 starts if it was even a little bit okay...but it's pathetic when it comes to noise cancellation. I always use to turn off Bluetooth mode whenever I get an incoming call...and it's also not good for recording voice messages as it will record all the sounds in that locality.,2
Medium quality,3
"One side got damaged within 4 months of purchase ,",2

Product finising is very poor,1
"You get what you pay for Decent sound quality and fit.Not much of connectivity issuesThe battery backup is absolutely poor, it lets for 1hr to 1 and 1/2hrs max.The case is very flimsy",2
"First off, pros:1) Sound quality is sufficiently good. It is not spectacular by any means but for the price, it is alright. The highs and mids are surprisingly clear. There is, however, no punchy bass and is very hard to achieve even with equalizers. 2) Battery lasts for quite a long time. It lasted me a full day of online classes with a mix of Netflix and YouTube content which all adds up to 8+ hours. 3) Range is quite good and I have observed no hitches. 4) The physical buttons are good...",4
Good colour is super,4
Worth a single penny,5
"Everything's thing is good. But while in call not able to talk clearly our voice is getting echo,  really Im using this only for listening songs",1

nice product with beautiful design and fast delivery.... once again thank you flipkart,5
"Built quality is very good. Bass is a bit too high to listen for longer periods. You may experience mild ear pain.If you love bass go for it, but if you rather prefer smooth and balanced sound, this will not please you...",4
They are just awesome . no less then JBL. vocals and both are in balance.clear sound even at highest volume. And its pretty good loud too. Totally satisfied at this price.,5
"Very good product.. loved the color and sound quality ❤️ It came with extra pairs of earbuds, overall the product is nice and worth money! Thank you Flipkart😊",5
Got it by the next day of order! Excellent service by Flipkart! The earphone is awsome! the Bass and treble is as perfect to hear! If your device has Dolby Atmos or any sound enhancements them the sound is as perfect as a nature sound. Wire is enogh long. Pros:1. The sound is excellent.2. wire is enough long.3. 3.5mm jack makes it good fr any smartphone.4. It also has mic.5. It has an premium look.Cons:1. Wire is little bit soft.2. Ear buds are mat finish.,4
price wise quality good. sound good. Bass is good. Everything about it is good not excellent. wire length is nice not to short nor to long. wire is tangle free. Build quality is good. in ear fit is good. Budget wise one can go for it.,4
The earphones looks so stylish and it's performance is amazing it offers a Great bass and it's supersonic looks is Wonderful ❤️ Thanks to Flipkart and boat for such a great product. Thank you thank you Thank you Flipkart so so much ❤️,5
"perfect one for music lovers.. Amazing bass and treble was also good.. loving it.. its a budget range gadget, I recommend it to everyone..",5
lovely one! loved the colour the design the shape the quality is absolutely fine good bass good audio quality I'm satisfied warranty card for 1 year and A small magazine is also in the box.  Go for it worth the Price 😄,4
"it's a decent product from boat, decent bass treble is good .if you want to buy a earphone that explodes with bass don't go for this one, but if you want clear punch and drums sound..than you should definitely buy this as its bass doesn't blend with treble and ruin the quality...overall nice product if you'll consider the price also",5
"Very good clarity, bass is also very good. I have previously used boat 225, compared to that , product is very light and prefectly fits in ear. Bass is slightly lesser than 225, clarity is very good somewhat better than 225, can hear every beat, microphone is also very good.Download a decent equalizer and you are all set.Last but not least ,awesome delivery by flipkart.",4
very good product . satisfied with it. good sounds quality. and very good while gymming. Worth it.,5
"Nice headphone.I have used both 100 and. 225 bassheads.the wire quality is also not so bad compared to bass head 225 and the best thing is in 225 the bass is over normal and so normal treble and vocal get suppress.But in 100 bass heads the sound is just balanced and bass is super and over all sounds awesome , if want a earphones and don't want over bass with suppressed treble and vocals then go with bass heads 100 where everything is balanced and. awesome.",3
"This earphones are recommended by mePros1. Very good sound quality, bass is well balanced with trible. 2. Light weight.3. Good wire quality.4. Mic is good and button is very useful for pause and play next song, also end call.5. Strap is useful. Cons1. Lack of 'L' shaped 3.5mm jack. 2. Position of buds are curved so always need to see which one is left or right.",4
After 6 month it won't work properly it's better to select other product than this even warranty is of no use they don't provide proper information it's better to select other than this even it's normal than other earphone,1
not a good one  ..I buy it seeing the review  but it seems a local one ..even if you will get like the same on Flipkart at a cost of Rs 200  but only thing is no branding will be there. sound quality is not good bass is like a phata hua dhool...,1

This Ear phones is very nice. But it's not comfortable to use calls because the volume controller and voice mic is too long that's Y it's not comfortable to take calls Otherwise it is excellent Sound and base Volume after 6(Six) Months it's not working,4
"very good sound value of money . Best in the market, can't get so good earplugs in this money",5
"I bought 1more and boAt BassHeads 100 headphones together, sound clarity, volume, bass and treble of boAt is much better than 1More. Comfortable ear buds, Zara Hatke design, sleek packaging. You don't wanna listen to music without boAt headphones. Truly price worthy.",5
ONE OF THE BEST HEADSET AT THIS PRICE👌👌GOOD SOUND QUALITY AND BUILD QUALITY IS ALSO AWESOME. BUT BASS IS NOT AT THAT GREAT BUT EVEN GREAT AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT. GO FOR IT GUYS. ALSO IT IS BEST FOR PUBG MOBILE.AWESOME,4
"simply awesome, nice quality but earpiece should little convenient with ears and the cable need atleast 6"" more. have a excellent sound quality and deep bass. love this product. keep it up boat.",5
l am happy with that purchase.... l like the design of the headphone.... l like the quality of the bass also...,4
zero bass. not worth the price ..better headphones for half the price like Flipkarts very own .build quality is ok .. headphones fits good in Ur ears .but important is sound quality which it lacks,1
"First of thnq too flipkart for Quick & fast service & it's sound quality is good , design awesome , & this price segment that earphone is pretty nice worth of money",5
I'm so so happy Very good product So so beautiful Sound effect super And also got it warranty card,5
"Prefer buying JBL C200SI, but at this price point, its good. If the jack would have been gold plated, it would have been the best wired earphone. It's design is great and is really comfortable. If you use it rough, it could last by mid of 4th month from the date of purchase. So yeah it's good.",5
Just a Wow product BoAt and amazing 🚚Delivery by Flipkart in the same day I ordered. Thank you Flipkart!!🥰🥰 Just loves it !,5
Perfect bass perfect build quality i hv been use it for past 2 months and it comes out with great performance... really Worth it :') for genuine music lovers...,5
Amazing headset no words for it. sound quality is very very good. Bass quality is awesome. Looks very beautiful and decent. Thanks to flipkart for providing this amazing product.,5
One of the best earphones I have ever tried....I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for best budget earphones for PUBG....and also for listening music!,5
nice product..  color is exactly shown in the pic.  best headset in this price range..  worth buying..  i ll suggest this product under this cost..  loved this headset from boAt.,5
Awesome Headset . I was searching for the same on Amazon however price was aboce 699/- and finally I got then on flipkart for just 399/-👍. Really Happy . Yes one area of improvement could be the timelines of delivering the product can be shorter,5
It's a really perfect earphone. I love it . Sound quality and base is too good in this cost.,3
Good earbuds at this price Range and Boat provides good product at Low budget and I think if you're looking for a earbuds that is good and your budget is Low than must Buy.,4
a very good earphone in budget sound is awesome very pure sound but the bass is ok ok..  you can go for it without thinking much,4
"guys, this is my genuine review. If you combine the sound and bass of the earphone, the sound is very low, and bass I kinda cool. if u wanna here some mass songs in this earphone or watch some action trailers in this earphone you'll be disappointed coz it only has bass. No sound even in full volume. but it's also kinda good for ur ears and head. if u come to it's design, man it's superbly made with that hawk inspiration. and also the wires are also very thick where there'll not be any damage ...",3
Amazing product boat is a very good product bass is awesome I really like it,5
"The colour is the highlight, looks pretty good on ears, good performance when jogging, holds tight to the ears, not so good when wearing with helmets as it jumps out as we remove, thus leading to breaking of cable maybe...",5
This earphone is really good especially it has a superb bass heads. It is being beautifully packed. They really provide four extra earbuds for backup and even it gives all the customers 1 year warranty. It is really one of the most fast delivery app. I got this earphone within 5 days and I actually like this colour it is Black Matt .❤🙏💯😊,5
"Good earphones, with great base and sound quality. I tried it by playing it with various songs. In short, it's a brilliant product with effective price and also you are getting 1 year warranty on this. So, it's a great deal.",5
That's good product their sound quality is Rich and comfortable to use it . My suggestion to bought blindly without any hesitation. Thank you Flipkart for providing such a better product or fastest delivery services.,5
"The headphones are good and comfortable but after usuage of 6 months , one side stoppped working.I have given the earphones for repearing but havent recieved them yet(21 days).Maybe due to the pandemic...but if you are looking for earphones for a good price.You may choose this.",3
truely awesome.. i am loving it.. best earphone in thus price.. just go for it.. honest review.. i cannot explain how happy i am for getting this..❤️❤️,5
The product is too good and sound quality is amazing ! I personally bought it for playing pubg and the response time is so good !,5
Just like any another earphones. Bass is not that special as said. Bass is normal like you get in any other normal earphone. It was a disspointment as they said this is a bass special.  Now only thing that will determine if these are good is the time. If they survived for 1 year without any fault then I will say they are good otherwise they are bad cause there is nothing special in this earphone.,1
This is a genuine review. Cros:For this price point this ear phones are perfect.It has mic which was very good. At this price. The sound quality is perfect and They will fit exactly in your the earsand it is completely awful.This will make neutral satification to play pubg as well.Cons:And the only thing this which is hesitating is little confusion among buds which is right and which is left,5
Writing this review after 6 months of usage.Sound clarity is very good. Not a single issue had come till now with it. The bass is nice but if you want more bass then I suggest you to go with the other product i.e. BoAt Bassheads 103. But if it's not the case then this one is best for you. It's truly value for money! Go for it!,5
This boAt BassHeads 100 has a decent sound quality but the Bass for which boAt is Known is too low so didn't give u a perfect sound quality but still good in its price segment,4
Superb Crisp Sound And Distinctive Sound Experience..If You want a Clear Crisp and HD Bass Experience. this One I would Recommend. I Tried All other Earphones But Sound i Clear And Crisp... luv u Flipkart ☺... And BoAT Accs Ltd... Muaaaaaaaah😘😘😘,5
It has better grip than others in the ears. One thing I noticed is that you feel like sound is coming straight from the phone and not through your ear phone. Many times I had to remove the ear phones to check whether the sound comes from the phone or from the ear phones. Good experience.,4
quality of the headphone is awesome and bass is superb  i am happy with this product 😄😃,5
Well it's a more than good earpiece at this price range. Not for bass lovers. Vocals and instrumentals feels well balanced. You can feel the decent beats. Don't expect too much at this price point.Use it with care otherwise it'll damage soon. ***personal experience***,4
"Its a good earphone overall. It possesses a good design, but has extremely thin wires especially at the upper part, so one has to handle it carefully. Where it shines is the sound quality. Trust me it has the best possible bass output when compared to other earphones in the same price segment. But don't expect that it will give you the same sound quality as Rs2000 jbl or Skullcandy ones. This is fine for day to day usage but if you want to buy an earphone for solely listening to music then go...",5
There's no battery since it is a wired one. And when I listen song's with full sound then the 2nd person can able to hear.. Apart from that it's good ☺️☺️.... Trands👌👌👌 is a UK Brand and I found that Trands is the best quality👍👍👌👌👌 ear plugs in terms... I request to Flipkart please add Trands ear phones.. You can check out Trands page in their fb and Instagram...,4
I wanna say it's really a good product and I leads in the top 10 headphones under 1000I would like if the earphones were a little bit more comfortableRegards!,5
Sound quality is Soo good at this price.... Good bass and also so easy to carry.... Value for money product must buy without hesitation....,5
"Sound & bass is balanced , ear bud's size is quiet good , earphone lead lenth is sufficient , earbuds outer design is extra ordinarily .2 set of buds are in bonus , which is a plus point to purchase this product .delivery is too fast & whishman behaviour was do good .He followed all the safety precaution of CORONA just like mask & social distancing etc. Thanks flipcart for this lovely product in reasonable price & ekart for its nice delivery .",5
This stuff is Awesome I had buy this for my mum it works cool excellent,5
absolutely good product and good bass and good quality at headphone  thank you boAt,5
"the quality of earphones are just fine, the length is right. There's enough bass. For this price range, is this probably the best you could get. Try getting it in a different shade, the pink looks a little cheap does looks like you've picked it up from the local railway station. Apart from that everything is good.",5
just good had some decent look and sound is great and the bass add some more juice to it total the music is just awesome,5
"great earphones with futuristic design . Looks cool .sound quality is excellent.bass is also somewhat upto the expectations.Cannot expect more in this range . just go for it , you'll love it.",4
nice hands-free now u can enjoy your music best for Music lover,5
"Have been using them for a couple of months now .. it has a very crisp sound output, the bass is good, you can hear each instrument being played clearly, so sound does not smudge, the product is strong and the buds make it isolate the external noise to minimum. DO NOT Compare with JBL / Bose headphones.. they have much better build and sound quality. if you are ready to spend 10k .. why not..?As a rider .. i wear my helmet always and use have used these headphones since purchase.. have ...",5
"one of the best earphones which you can get at this price .It's being few months since I am using this product and till now i have got amazing results . Bass is good and appropriate, microphone quality is also good .overall feedback -value for money product",5
Best in budget earphones......sound quality is just awesome..bass is so deep considering pricesound is also punchyvocals are also clearly audibleone more thing it just fits so perfectly in your ears...PERFECT EARPHONES FOR YOU IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE...😍😍🤑,5
Very decent and nice sound in this price segment. Actually i even got 10 % discount on this product. I bought it for my girlfriend and she is quiet happy with the pink earphones. Highly recommended. Bass is okay but overall above average.,5
Excellent product @this price. Super Sound quality and nice looking pair.  I Specifically like its design by which it's so comfortable to fit in ear that you don't think that you have wear headset.  Good sound with decent bass and with added ear buds you can adjust your comfort zone.  So All I will Say A classy But Yet Powerful product By Boat..,5
Color is so pretty. Girly earphone. And durable. I have order it again as i used boat earphone black coloured for 1year and it’s still so good and I gifted that to my mom and ordered again this pink coloured boat earphone. Its so good. Worth the price. Just go for it. ❤️,4
I purchased this on 7th june 2019 and one side of the earphone stopepd working and the jack was also become loose . When i applied for the warranty it took one month to come but the best thing is they gave me a new one . It's awesome yaar . I liked the assurity of boat .,5
This a very good earphone under a good budget. I gifted it to my gf.  she is very happy with this.,5
"Packageing very cute,for gifting, small waranty card  earphone quit good sound quality good and fast and early delivery which is good experince with flipkart all amazing experince , i use this and give the feedback sound is good base is not good and this time it has problem after 3 month , no voice come so quality is not good you can buy real me earphon which is good",1
i have been using MI earphone but i was purchased boat earphone for my friend .both i was compared boat earphone not better than MI earphone. my honest recommendation is only MI earphone👌👌👌,1
"a little delicate for me but maybe fine for others because most of the headsets are built likely the same, but I tend to break my headset frequently so I am being extra careful with them. The sound quality is nice, I love it. I ordered the pink one so that only I can use them. go for it.",4
these headphones are basic headphones... although it has a very good microphone and ...ear tips are so comfortable..but it's comes with only two sizes ...it doesn't comes with extra lagre size airtips..wire quality is good ...also colour of the wire is very good..everything is good except bass....normal day to day life earphones ...for normal headphone users ...it is not for music lover ...or not for gamers..it just a basic headphones...,2
"Mic not works properly, bass is not also good as compared to other products of boat.This item is not is not suitable for phone call, because mic is pathetic.",2
Base is not much as expected But sound quality is perfect 😊Lenth of the wire is good you can wear it under your shirtOver all good,4
awesome product at best price I love it thank u flipkart,5
best headset I had ever seen.... nice sound quality and bass and best water proof headset.... I just put in water for 5hr but still it is good sound quality...,5
The King of Bass terrific product super bass worth for money got it for 300 Rs only product is over the expectations. mind blowing product better than skull candy earphones which I bought it earlier which was priced around 900Rs.simply go for it.,5
"Great Experience..the sound output is good may differ from phn2phn, i hav nokia device this boat works well in it. For great bass use wynk music select headphones in equalizer.",5
earphones are may be suitable for most types of mobiles and is superb sound clarity and bass is good,4
Good quality earphones....comes with 2 extra pairs of earbuds. Good sound quality and value for money.It comes with mic so u can use it for concalls.Only thing I did not like is - Its wire quality is not flexible.,4
"I got the delivery of boAt BassHeads 100 wired earphone within two days of ordering. It comes in a standard cover along with a small polyester envelope and 2 pairs of spare ear buds. The earphone has a built-in microphone and click button for receiving calls, play/pause music and fast forwarding of songs.Pros:1. Sound quality is amazing in this price, total value for money.2. Bass is quite high, but nothing problematic to ears.3. Wire is tangle free and is having a matte finish giving it ...",5
Best earphone and good customer service by boat they replaced my product at my door step as they promised us one year warranty thing is that after four months my earphones one side not working so raise the complaint on boat website and they replaced my product on their replacement TAT with assurance so now I got again brand new boat earphones I'm happy with boat service.Thanks,5
"This earphones are great at this price in terms of sound clarity and quality. Nothing extra pure clear audio. Same quality is delivered at double to triple of this price by other brands. Now coming to cons and drawbacks. I am giving you my example. I bought it ,one side stopped working in 11 months it was under warranty so got replaced by a new one with 0 charges ,the replaced none stopped working after 18 months. I did not handle this earphones with much care. I sleep with them it gets tang...",4
"I dont know why there are a lot of bad reviews. This is a really good set of earphones. It lastedgor about 8 months. It could have lasted more, but I am a harsh user. Thus a side of this earphone stopped working. I mistakely stretched the earphones lot more than it should have been stretched. I recommend this earphone. The sound quality is really good and the bass quality is pretty good compared to other earphones.",5
This is the 3rd boat earphone that I have bought from flipkart. And i have not regretted.

"Earphone is good,  I like the soft pink girly color,  bass and sound quality is good but didn't like one thing... It doesn't fit properly in my ears.. Keep . falling.. This is  irritating.. Over all good product coz it has one limitation.. Thank you ekart and flipkart for providing these kinds of products when going market can be life threatening",4
This is my second time ordering these headphones. The sound quality is good except when you're driving the noise cancellation is not to great extent. Apart from that very comfortable and durable,4
I purchased this product a very long time ago. At that time I got more pairs of extra ear tips and the wire is also so tangle free. But now this in this product I got only two pairs and the wire quality is not so good and it is just above par. The sound quality is good as well as bass. The two cables after the dissection from microphone looks very thin and make to feel I should take care about them while I use.,5
The earphone are Matt colours and looks very premium. The bass quality is good as compared to various earphones which comes in the same prices . I got it for 384 /- which I think was a great deal !! Thank you Flipkart . The delivery was way before time .,5
"I loved it... What can I wish more... It's an Indian company with a cool design, good sound quality... Loved it...",5

"Amazing product for listening,valuable price of a product and superb sound with bass.I satisfied to this product and this company also.it's your time what are you waiting for it just order know and enjoys the moment...",4
"After 10 month i m writing review regarding boAt BassHeads 100 Wired Headset. I have use lots of headset in the range of 250-500, most of them are enough good and last for 8 months.This product gave me lots of satisfaction. 6month after purchase i claimed for warranty, the product is been replaced within few days and the preformance is is better than i used the products earlier. So you can trust this product.",4
"Very good clarity, bass is also very good.Good sound quality good strength wire quality overall nice product.Most affordable and best value for money no doubt.",5
"I got this product in 340 only , this is much better then the other 500+ products having good sound quality & mic is also very good as i can talk in loud also. BOAT is making such a reliable product. Must buy.",5
"This is is very good wired headset and bass is also good, overall music quality is very good speaker reception is is also very good overall it's a great product and you can buy this product without any doubts.",4
In this price the product is good and sound quality is better than other. Comfortable in ear with the help of extra buds,5
"Good 4 gaming,it has a good BasS compair to others,  ear phones...,but at this price range there are many other good ear phoneZ...i bought @419....the delivery was perfect....",3
Quality is good. Bass is quite good but u can increase from equalizer. Good for listening music but not recommended for PUBG. Left and right sound like footprints and firing sound is not clear n differentiative.,4
"Best design ,perfect fit in ear, mic is good and the sound quality is nice.but bass is average in my opinion. One of the best headset in this price segment",5
download equalizer  fx  and   on super bass (and switch on the bass boost) then see the magic .you can get the wonderful bass experience.,5
"This product is good for listening songs and the bass quality is good but not up to the mark as I expected. But the design could be more better... But in all aspects review you can choose it ,the earphone is good",4
"Superb product at this price. I loved it. I'll suggest, just go for it. Givest the best value of money.",5
"very good 👍😊😘 product, sound quality is very nice , completely 4th months using then right review, nice head phones",5
"Amazing product with superb quality and good base and clear call connectivity,, thank you Flipkart and superb seller",5
Great pair of earphones. This is my second time buying the same product and am extremely happy with the performance. Another icing on the cake is that it is from an Indian company. I will keep preferring Boat devices over foreign brands .,5
very nice product.. very smooth base and clarity also good which is best for our ears.. Thanx flipkart,5
Good product in this price and the sound was perfectly clear Base also good super product,5
"The quality is really good, the bass isn't too much great in this but the clarity of voice is really awesome! must have at this reasonable price!",5
"Excellent Headset, Good sound quality with crystal clear noise free sound. Bass quality is great.. overall great product.",5
Good one. I Bought this and MI Basics together (boat for brother) I am satisfied with both. Both had same specs and audio quality. But I felt that Boat was sound good on non-MI phone (which is his) and MI one best work on MI phone(mine). Boat buds were quiet lighter than MI buds and it would survive more damages than MI. 1 year warranty on boat as compared to 6 months of MI. Both are satisfying and worth buying.,5
Just go for this !!!I have bought various earphones but none of then are good or even close enough to this earphones The only draw back for this earphone is the mic is where the left and right wire are connected so when over call you need to lift up the mic near to  your face for clear audio otherwise it will give you a very good audio while watching movie listening music or playing games such as pubg in which coordination is requiredNot to think much just go for it !!!,5
"best earphones at this price, smooth and lovely voice with comfort",5
Nice headphones supper sound and good bass and also thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery iam happy with this headphone,4
i had cx180 for like 3.5 years ..not better than cx180 but great at this price point.value for money item,5
"I am genuinely disappointed by this, as i inferred it was a good quality accesories provider given that I do own a boat's headphone. But this doesn't have much anything to be worth recommending for. The sound volume is low, it lacks clarity at the highest volume it can afford and even at lowest levels it doesn't have much of clarity let alone bass. I would rather buy the home-owned brand of its competitive leader in e-shopping, which i got just for 50 when it was launched. Till now, i haven't...",1
"Awesome Product ! Specialy Bass. Fits Very Well. Light Weight. I think this is the best quality earphone in this range. Thanks to Flipkart for the Fastest Delivery , it arrived at just 20 hours ! Sound Quality is Very Well !",5
Best head set on cheap rate   Itz the one of best headset on the cheap rate. I have been reviewing after using for over a month. Best deep bass. Very gud performing in any equalizer. Comfortable in ear design wid long wires. Itz mic does an decent job. But don't hve the noice reduction for mic itz the only drawback,5
Great headsets it succeeded three category. Those are:1. Good and clear sound even droplets of water could be heard. 2. Superbb bass it gave the feel as if the music being played in a Bluetooth speaker. 3.sweet and soothing sound that( harshness and rough ness were absent) makes u feel like heavens joy. Also gave phone less battery stress after hearing for continuous 1.5 hrs only 7% battery was drained. Highly recommended in low range headsets best from my view. To get a clarity bass jus...,5
Bassheads?? I don't think so. Loud but voice ia not clear at full sound or bass heavey. You can buy it for its great mic. Crystal ckear. If you talk too much on phine this is the one. Reviewed on my youtube channel Traveltech FUN make you decesion as per your preference. Not for bass heavy music but for long clear chats.,2
Good sound. Bass is great on hd music. Most importantly they are comfortable to the ears and have a good grip. Great buy in this budget.,5
"If you are opting it for heavy bass, please don't buy a it don't have any. Very basic level of bass only. Design and build quality is superb as well sound quality which is some what better. But for me I love bass and I don't get it.",1
along with this i ordered boult storm...its quality is far better than this...the wire quality is not that good and often tangles are formed...sound precison and quality is not good.. if u get boult at the same price go for it ...dont just rely on the brand name ...i assure that boult is far better than boat,2
This head phone is not good enough. The sound quality is not good. Vocals are good but bass and other instrumental sounds are bad. I expect much better head phone from boat. The wire quality is also not good. I think Boat should improve their headphone quality in aspect of sound and wire too. Thank you. :-(,2
Superb product against the price whats attract is the price and design and the amazing sound quality worth the price but quality should improve little,4
"Design not so good, as not handy sharp cone and layered cone not so good.Sound: very goodBass: best in classValue: trueShape :?",3
"It is good sound quality is also good but sometimes sound fluctuation happens in the earphone. I like the designing, colour is my fav, not sure about the durablity but sound quality is good.",4
Product quality is awesome ..sound abd base quality is great at this price. I'm very happy with that.. delivery experience is great before date delivered,5
Flipkart is best super fast delivery i like it and this earphone is the best earphone in 400 rs super earphones Design is so good,5
"very less bass with comparable to my MI earphone basic bought in same range, but vocal clarity is best in boat. overall decent gift for my wife.",3
"I used this product for five months, and then its jack was not working. So requested for a return/repair to boAt customer care. Trust me guys, their service is too good and I received a new one. Thanks to boAt for such wonderful product and service.",5
"This is my first buy from this boAt brand..First I was wondering that it's price is too cheaper so that will be not as much expected..But it proves me wrong..After reading all this reviews I ordered this headset..It has good sound quality, bass quality is also good..Overall it's perfect in this price...It also comes with 1year warranty card..So happy with this purchase and I will recommend this product..😊✌️",5
The best part of this headset is the noise cancelling... Other headset might require a high volume to get the hold of all beats... But this one is clearly the best in terms of bass and noise cancellation... Worth every penny,5
"It's a very good headset in this range...specially if you're looking for a headset with Extra bass, then it's the perfect choice..a little bend in the speaker position is make it a good fitted headset.... highly recommended ✌️",5
"Amazing Earphones at this budget. The build quality is very good. You will never feel uncomfortable while wearing these. The Sound Quality, Bass and Treble are the best according to me in this price sector. However, its button is not working and the jack is not gold plated as mentioned. But overall the best earphones at this budget.",5
I was using skull candy headsets.   Boat has low bass out .  Noise cancellation is good cant use while driving..... For attending callsIts good for hearing peace minded songs... Especillay trance and electronicNot suitable for melody and rap...  Can try it worth the cost,3
"This is not good product , I was also using previous ear phone that was too good but this ear phone wire is very thin , this is bad in quality only in wire by the way sound quality is good and base quality is also very good",1
"Amazing earphone in this price range , awesome built and dynamic bass clears the sound and give us an home theatre type sound",5
Its really nice products & looking so stylist with clear sound with comfortable bass n 1 yr warenty.realy awesome product.love it❤❤☺,4
"it's not good as Sony or Sennheiser headphones if you want a basic headphones not so good to hear music ,to recieve calls it will be a best option for hands free other wise don't buy it for music purpose , my ears got pain after I used it for 15 minutes",1
"I have been using this product for over 6 months now and it is working great, Crystal clear sound both through speaker and mic. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is because the bass is not too good. Otherwise I would recommend this product and say that it is worth it.",4
best wishes for BOAT for giving this kind of headset at budget price..I loved the sound quality very much.. happy with this product.. posting this review after using 3months from the date of purchase..,5
Not good product sound quality average bass is good I recommend to sennsizer CX 180 For Bass Lover n sound quality,1
delivery is done within 2 days but product is not at all good .its just a simple earphone which is stylish that's all thank u flipkart,1
in 400 price superb earphone bass is better and sound quality is better but jbl sound is better than it.,4
"Nice for the price, good sound, but if you have already used boat 220 or 225 you will not find it very impressive but for the first time buyers it's a Paisa vasool item, anytime superb than the local or generic earphone.Bass is actually quite good as it's a basic earphone of boat, but no wonder thousands of people are rating it as good as it's really worth the money.Go for it guys if you can't extend the budget , you'll not regret.",4
"Awesome product really reliable, nd better than most of the chinese product, proud to you make in india product, proud to be part of #vocalforlocal",5
Bass is good ...But the sound is low.....i can hear more clearly when i use Samsung normal earphone....but i have to increase the volume quite to reach to that level...the treble and bass overtake the clarity of words.,3
"Just good and decent earphones. Build quality is good. Somehow, I liked the Mi basic earphones to be more rich in sound and bass.",3
Good product Thank you Flipkart fast delivery Thank a lot,5
"At a price range of 375-399 it is the the best anyone can get..i bought it for 375.. its good for Every purpose in terms of erphones but For Games like PUBG ,Fortnite, better spend atleast 200 more to get an earphones with better Soundsense for left/right differentiation. Its is excellent choice in this price bracket.",5
"1st day review : This sounds amazing.....Good bass and for such a cost, You will not be disappointed...I brought it, tested it with some songs and i can clearly hear the song...The product is good...Lets see what happens in future....1 week review : The mic is amazing ...The receiver has no trouble to listen what i say from the mic during calls...It is still giving good bass.. I can say to anyone that this is the best earphones under 500/-.",4
It is good for regular use but the bass is not that great...still the product is a good one and worth the money,5
I am so much satisfied of this product.best bass . sound is awesome 😊😊 thank you so much ❤️,5
In love with the fiery red smart unit... The bass is awesome on ears....,5

This earphones have decent sound and good for listening music but I can ear the background voice the noise cancellation is not that great it can be used for pubg but it doesn't have the base it needs like u can't hear long-range clearly but mid range is clear the other variant of boat thats boat 225. Is good with bass and great for pubg,3
"This is a super headset with amazing quality,more affordable,I love this brand,it's truly worth for the money ,the sound effect is amazing,the packaging was supr, there is no any irritation the drawback is ,right side is only suitable for right ear",5
"worked well for six months. one ear piece damaged within the period of warranty. trust me it won't last one year , think before buying. not a good service from a company like boat.",4
Sound quality is awesome . Cool handy design  with incredible sonic clarity sound with extra bass. 🖤,5
"Personally I love Boat Earphones.. The service is so quick and the Brand is trustworthy... However, there is only one Service center is available to avail the Warranty in Jogeshwari, Mumbai. This Boat BassHead 100 is Cheapest Earphones of Boat And The Quality is Superb..Go for it",5
"Super hot Headphone..!!! Just got in 399/-, thank you flipkart.Fastest delivery it's within 2 days. Just try it you will like it",5
Its name was bassHead 100 but the bass was little bit low you have to improve bass     Thank You....      Satisfied,5
good audio quality. stylish finish. good material. this is a good value for money buy. go for it.,5
Very nice headset sound quality is very awesome i like this headset value of money i am happy for buy this headset,5
Nice product. Comfortable and good sounding earphones. What more would you expect from a 400 rs earphone. Bass and mids are a bit low but it gets the job done. Mic position is low so i have to raise it when i speak.,4
"Honestly speaking, u cannot expect anything more in this price range. Though the bass is a little low and quality of sound is not the best but it gets the work done for me. Songs are enjoyable and gameplay is nice. The mic position is a little low so i have to raise it everytime i speak to someone which is kind of annoying.",4
Very good sound quality bass is to good over all good thank you boat,5
"compare with other earphone on this price range it's good sound quality is not bad this is a mix of voice and bass compare with mi and samsung boat is good if u have a price range of above 600 then go for boat bassheads 182 , it's better for 600 500 rs . i had a comparison",4
"Why are you Flipkart guys asking me about Battery life have you lost it?Anyways coming to review:Pros1. Crispy clear sound2. Great for music and streaming.3. Great for calls.Cons1. Bass is good but because of plastic body it's misses boom effect. It's bass is more like baam.2. If you're thinking of gaming like playing pubg on this then forget it, infact punish yourself by Unistalling pubg because your thinking is lika a noob you won't make any better.3. Clip kyu kha gaye ek hi toh ty...",4
Fantastic quality ..worth buying it ..and for brand lovers the best at lowest cost ..good bass also so happy buying it at 400.,5
"It's a very nice product it is currently very useful for my online classes during this lockdown . And the delivery was very quick , even quicker than expected. It worths the price and I suggest everyone looking for a good earphone should buy it .",5
Excellent customer service by the flipkart team delivery was pretty fast it was 3 days earlier than the date mentioned thank you flipkart,5
"Good but not best.. Sound quality ok ok.. but Flipkart doing his job very well like packaging, delivery time, I'm Satisfied. Thank you.",4
It's been 9 month now n it works very well. I will recommend all to buy this product. Love it ❤,5
Ordered these bassheads if i not reveiw then also it is clear that how much good it is as lakhs of people are preferring these bassheads.,5
"Good wire quality, not too soft or too hard, bass is good , doesn't cause any pain to ears , best in this price segment, but delivery was a bit late , though could understand less delivery person during lockdownAfter 10 months usage, the wire rubber starts degrading and the headphones might break",4
Super cool Headphone with stylish design and sound quality is Awesome in these Price Range🔥,4
It is very good product best part after using 6 month I dmage the products due to my negligence and contact to customer care they pick my product from my house in covid period and replace my headset with a neew one... I just love the brand boat...,5
Good headset for daily use. Nice quality. I like mi basic more because of crisp vocals and metal sound chamber.,5
Okok product. Looks cool but a but of letdown on brand name. My ubon earphones were of much better sound quality. Wires are tangle free which is very handy. Earplugs are also soft and easy on ear. But might fall down while moving. Strap is useful. Fast delivery,4
Very good product bye boat..It has very good base and sound quality is also good I love it...❤️,5
"Superb sound quality with great bass and clear sound even in full volume ,the great experience, Go for it if u want Loudness n good bass 👌👌",5
The Sound is very crystal clear in this price range but will be a bit pricky in the ear .Design wise its good but handle with care otherwise one side will surely stop working .Mic is also perfect.,4
"very beautiful or affordable product in cheap range, beautiful sound quality, amazing looking... I love it ❤",5
The headphones worked very well for the first few months and then the mic suddenly stopped working and after fee days the right plug stopped working. The first 7 months it worked so well but then it started giving distorted sounds. I had high expectations from this product.,3
"I bought it for my uncle and he is very satisfied with the product. Build quality is good, sound clarity and bass is good too. The best wired earphones at this price range I guess.",4
"Good product.. but bass is not like wings and Philip's earphones...try wings wireless neck band...mast hei...as I hv wings,Philip's,Intex and now boat in comparison to all wings is best then Philip's and intex and last boat",5
It's good and I got it in good condition. I want to say thanks flipkart and it's implementation team for faster delivery.,4
Sound quality is really awesome for this price range.Build quality is not so good though .... overall its a highly recommend and good product by boat.,5
Awesome product....the sound clarity is good and faster delivery got in 2 days...thanks to flipkart,5
Olson nice prodect    .   boat  is amazing  i love it      . nice  bass  .  but build quality is  down .alwise nice .🇮🇳🇮🇳,5

They Are just osm . No less than Jbl vocal and both are in balanced . Clear sound even at higest volume .and its pitty good loud too . Totally satisfied at the price .,5
"The headphone is best under 500rs and i am quite impressed by the sound quality, great for playing pubg and also for listening to music..also the bass is good and ultimately It is worth buying ,i  have used it for a week and then giving my opinion based on my experience..u can go for it without thinking twice..good luck",5
Really happy and satisfied after purchasing this earphone... I have seen many comments where many people didn't like the earphone but from my personal point of view I am happy buying this..Go for it 👍,5
Product was good good for just 2 months one of the head stopped working now  not that worthy,3
Its a nice budget friendly headset from boat. But there is no bass effect in this. The look is stylish. You can use it for a clear audio and not for a powerful bass effect.,4
Terrific product This is the great purchase in that great price so if you want listen crystal clear voice then you are definitely go to for it thank you filpkart,5
Excellent sound quality and used material are very strong .and the design is also fit absolutely value for money of this product . I love it ❤️,5
"Crisp and clear Sound with balanced bass. All type sound test cleared easily. Value for money, cost effective for a decent headset. Only 1 drawback is this headset lacks volume rocker!",5
Sound and bass quality is incredible ...but I think it's built quality should be better . It's wire   s are very thin . Look also not much good .,4
Best buy in such price tag buying for 3rd time from boat. As expected. Nice sound quality. Just one issue. The spare buds are not at all adjusting in any of them other than that it's a good product.,4
The product is good in this price range. Sound is perfect and clear ans bass is not up to mark but considering price range it is justified. And the reason of giving 3 star is delivery by flipkart they take 7 days to diliver these earphones,3
"Just no talk about its quality of this ear phone . Sound is absolutely clear . And bass is also good . One can buy without any hesitation ....!!!  But delivery is very delay of this product . I have got it after 2 day of promise day , mentioned by seller . But the delivery boy's behaviour is very good .",4
Good build quality.Wire is good will last long.Sound full of Bass....good at this price point.Call quality was fine for me.Battery consumption will check n edit the review with details.Worth the money spent!,5
Very fast and good delivery service special thanks to delivery boy who real hero who provide us good service in this corona crisis... Good product please buy this product it's very good,5
Super comfortable and very clear sound .... Proper balance of bass and audio ..... Some ear phones are only good for the bass but these earphone is a balanced one... Go for it #worth buying,5
"Good quality. Good sound. But we can't say that it's best. Realme earphones are quite better than it in same price. Bass is a little bit low. Compared to it's price, it is good product. But not a best suggestion.",4
The earphone is best in this price range the bass is good treble is bit low the wire। of this earphone is good quality if you want low budget earphone this good for daily use overall a good quality product by boat,4
"I got to listen to very nice clear sound quality , beat , fresh music of the song in this headphone .....Great !!!!!",5
Nice quality in its price. Sound quality is good but bass is not up to the mark .But still it is recommended to buy.,4
"Nice bass , good sound quality that is why I always prefer boat. last time it was also fantastic,Over all it was good, thank you",5
It's an one of the best product from boAt  it is valuable For this rate below 400/- i am impressed i prefer to you to buy,5
Awesome simple awesome sound quality very very happy with the product best earphone in this price range,5
"Ossum good sound quality, super bass, excellent structure, simply superb, just ossum. It is not fits in the ear on the beginning and then after practice it fits perfectly",5
Low bass good for those who is not a big fan of bass. Vocals are very clear and sound is good in this price range. Wire quality is also very good.,3
Nice product with the price tag it comes. Sound is clear though doesn't have really deep bass but that can't be expected at this price. If looking to have good ones which delivers great against their price then surely consider them buying👍💯,4
It's one of the worth the price product I have purchased from fk. U should definitely go for this wired earphones if u are looking for good product in cheap price. It's definitely the worth the price product. They also give one more pair of ear buds. The design and the structure of the product is also mind-blowing and the sound quality is also great. If u want to buy a boats product u can definitely go for this one.,5
"amazing product, i m using this product since 3 month and i writing the review today still it is working exactly like new good base quality and super durability. i m happy with this product in this range this is adorable go for this.",5
"I love this boat earphones........ Its bass is very good... And its look good, comfortable in ear........ And also its audio quality is very smooth...... Love this..",5
This is why I love boat stuffs. As they try to put everything to make the sound quality great and to make it a genuine experience in a very affordable price. I always get impressed by their stuffs. I have headphones and earphones both of boat and both are very amazing,4
Excited to use. Delivery boy's behavior was extremely polite on call. Before time delivery by Flipkart even during Pandemic. Warranty card of 1 year was worth to see.,5
"This one is my second pair, gifted to my wife. The first pair lasted more than 2 years and is still doing good. Excellent quality. I wud never go for battery based bluetooth as these last lifelong and are cheaper .",5
Superb Quality at this Price Range... Yess Bass is A Little less than i expected... But it gives a Solid Crisp Sound.,5
Its good but just the upper side of the wire is pretty much weak. Otherwise its great nice to hear wd it,5
"It is a good product if you see by the design.But I feel it is not that loud in crowdy places. I used it while I was travelling via train and the sound was not much audible. Again the ear piece wires are a little bit thin. So there are chances of tearing. But that has never happened to me. Bass is not excellent but of average. I am using this product for a year. And I found no serious problems.It is one of the best earphone if you have an average budget. Otherwise, you may extend your b...",4
Very Comfortable and gives good quality of sound.You can't get such a good product at such a low price.Love this Product.,5
Its very bad..its good at first six month..after that none is working..its like a plan that it has six month warranty...lets have then do something that it will only work 6-7 months..i did not expect that,2
Audio works fine.Bass is not that good.And don't consider it for gaming purpose especially PUBG as the sound isn't that clear.Its fine for the price but JBL is way better for game sound,3
The advantages with rating and disadvantages I noticed are listed belowAdvantages:1. Superb sound quality (9/10)2. Mic quality is good (7/10)3. Bass is moderate and it is neither too low nor too high (7/10)4. We can clearly hear the detailing of the song (8/10)5. Perfectly fit in ears (10/10)6. It wont slip even if when dancing or running7. No pain for ears even if we used it for hours8. 3 sizes of earbuds are there9. The wire it tangle freeDisadvantages:1. Discomfort for ears ...,5
This has nice sound quality ...sound is little bit higher than that of mi basic earphonesCons:It's design makes uncomfortable to remove from earsThe mic is at the joint ...so while talking over phone u have to put the mic closer to the mouth to have a clear voice Sound quality is nice,4
Awesome product I like it best quality bass sound design amazing worth for price,5
"I loved this headset , crystal clear sound bass is awesome I love boat wonderful headset 😘  Thank you flipkartBut 1 thing it takes 5 long days to deliver the product .Overall awesome product  5/5",5
Nice budget earphones to buy.Wire seems to be quite delicate so i bought a earphones case to protect this.Overall sound quality is best in class.Go for it.,5
"Very well product 👍 go for it without hesitation. The bass of this headset is not that much boasted, although good bass and very well sound quality. In this range 💪 boat is offering a very good deal. Don't miss it.",4
I cant believe the price and the sound and quality of this product.. Actually i m boat lover always.. This is my 3rd one.... I have already rokerzz 255 pro.. Basshead 220..but u cant believe this the sound of this price range.. 1st i compaired betwwen rokerzz255 pro vs this one.. I was shocked...... Then i realize that both r gd..but The 255 pro much better.. Oviously bcz of price dfrns.. this is amezing quality and amezing sound..... I love this family... 400 rs.. Just speechless fav hdph......,5
This the best earphones at this price if u r less on money u can buy this these are best and most durable earphones at this price point really enjoying it with heavy usage they are good at ears no pain or irritation they fit very nicely👍👍 value for money product,5
Best earphone I had used everThe sound quality is just mindblowingThe bass is just perfect above averageAnd the vocals are crystal clear I just got it for 374 it is more than worth it don't think just go for it,5
Super product...  better for this price. Nice sound clarity and bass.,4
"The sharp edges pokes the ear when you lay on your ear side,surrounding sound is not properly blocked when listening songsThe jack makes noice when touches even a bit.Sound is clear but not that clear,and its not a bass boosted.But,its better than cheaper models of sony,jbl,seinheisser,philips etc...Mic. will become bad,if you click much.",4
"I received this headset today. And I am really happy to buy it. Though bass is not quite good but in this price range I think it's really good. Look is great. Wire is tangle free, which is a big positive for me. Packaging was good too. They have provided extra set of ear buds too.  Along with you get a warranty card for one year. So what are you waiting for go and buy it now!!",4
these are good earphonesat this price don't expect it to have base like BOSEvery good quality and sound is clear and most important won't hurt your earsGo for it,5
"Decent headsets with decent amount of bass. If you are a bass lover, then this might not be the choice (boAt Rockerz Bluetooth Wireless are too good when it comes to bass). Rest, it maintains a perfect balance between bass and treble.Go for it if you are not fond of high bass. Cons - feels very delicate because of its thin wires, but if handled carefully, they are really good at this price point. Overall, 8/10.",5
Very nice product. I gifted this to my brother on his birthday and he is really happy with the output of it. Thanks Flipkart,5
"Writing this review after using this headphone completely for 5 months. It was delivered to me on 1st Jan and till now it is in very good condition. The bass, volume, sound quality, wire quality everything is very very very good. Happy with boAt BassHeads 100 Wired Headset..Thanks Flipcart for selling such a good product...",5
Delivery of this product take much time But delivery boy was good he took precautions before giving this product to me and about the product I will say #AWESOME You must buy this the sound quality is good and the bass is superb This earphones make the sound clear and detailed.

Has an awesome sound quality and clarity. Has Deep Bass and is durable and has a good design protocol. Must buy if you're looking for budget wired earphones.,5
Nice product.Sound clarity is vry good & fast deliver.. Thank you Flipkart,5
"Not the best, but does the work perfectly. Sound and mic quality are both nice.If you're buying it just for work from home stuff such as skype and zoom meetings, you can go for it.If you're a gamer or music lover, please do not expect any wonders. However I bought it for Skype meetings and it works perfectly for me. No issues found in two weeks. Would update the review if I find any issues.",5
I loved it. Thank you flipkart for the product and I got it at just 418 bucks. I am so happy with the product.,5
"Very nice product.. Really loved it.. I recommend all to try this once.. I am sure you all will love it. Nice sound quality, nice and deep base. Owsome😍😍😍",5
Everything in this headset is good but who buy this product for good bass will be disappointed for a neutral good sound and frequency u can buy this..... The build is good but the ear buds are made up of plastic so i this that dont have a long life it will be known on using ...... 1 year warranty is given so no problem at all.... Best budget earphones for music lovers,4
"It has good bass and it's very comfortable for ear.., design is fabulous.., and in very low price uh get best product..!",5
"Awesome. Don't think much more. Just go for it. Awesome product. Nice built in quality. Clear bit. Nice bass...... Trust me, in this price you will not get such a good product. So, Buy it....",5

"This product is good for the money invested . Sound quality , base and design are pretty decent for the money.",5
"The product is good at this price point, I appreciate that they delivered me this earphone in the middle of the pandemic which is really impressive.The delivery guy was good. All over a good experience",5
Good one. But not fitting for redmi mobiles. In my mi mobile only for call it's clear in case of songs or videos it's not good with noise cancellation. Felt bad. I thought it would be supported to all at the time of buying. But after receiving it's supports to all except redmi. Not checked with realme too.,5
"A very good,easy to use , product. Bass is pretty good . Quality and design is also remarkable. Overall it is worth the money",5
Mast Ekach Number.. Not irritated at high volume also.. Fast delivery during knockdown.. Nice packaging original product with warranty card and manual.. I am Happy 😊 #music lover,5
"So , i will be totally honest about this. I was expecting very good quality but this didn't  performed  that well.The sound levels are not balanced and bass is also low.You will not notice it until you compare it any other earphone. I compared it with my Realme Buds 2 wired earphone and Boat didn't even come close to it.I had listened so much about Boat Company but i came to know its quality after i I used it.The built quality is decent but sound quality is not upto the mark.I suggest ...",3
"Very good and durable earphones! I have used JBL, Skullcandy earphones, but they are not durable as this peice of Jem! Reasonable and worth a buy for daily rough use!",5
A value for money headphone for bass lovers. The sound quality(vocal) is good but not the best when compared to jbl.  Bass is amazing that you will be blown. overall a massive product for this price.  Loved it since its first use.,5
Best headphone thanks flipcartFor send me .the courier service is very good friendly behaviour and helpful,5
best nd reasonable nd nice built quality nd sound is best in this range,5
Beautiful and attractive   pink color It sound of earphone is quality is very good I like it&awesome,5
"The popular brand Boat gave this earphone a unique design but get lacked in it's built quality. It is very light in weight(similar to local ones).Apart from that, sound quality is bit good but might be not upto your expectation. It will give only a balanced sound which is only good for watching movies, not for songs. If you are a deep bass lover and doesn't cares about treble go for boat 220.thanks.",4
"Recieved same as in the description, Sound Quality is crystal clear, no noise, pure bass , thrilling treble, fits in ears smoothly, comes with different size rubber ear buds, looks elegant with different color choices, has mic.",5
Pretty decent! Lasted for 6 months..  So better to put 500 rs more and buy jbl/seinheiser.. Boult is good too..!,3
Everything is good with this earphone. But there are few draw backs as well for example I tried this with MI and SAMSUNG AND OPPO. among them it worked very good with MI only..,4
"Pretty instrumental device. Good quality sound. Listening to ASMR is just stunning. Just a month old to me, can't comment on its durability right now.",4
"Good sound quality, best build design, volume and bass is good...... Flipkart service is better in other shopping companies.... thank you Flipkart",5
"Excellent Sound quality, clarity and thumping bass, Good sound separation (Like sony), Best Product for audiophiles in this price.",5
"Good one in this price range@400.Really liked the sound quality, material could be much better but overall nice one from boat",4
A well Balanced Design with good sound quality with balanced bass.,4
Stylish and comfortable to wear. Isolates the sound very well from external noise. Sound quality is good which is worthy at this price range. Highly recommended.,5
So So so good and very best base... and wire quality is a best of all . i like this eaephone ♥️♥️,5
Best quality. Company service is good. Worth for money. I'm really happy with this product. Nice product.,4
All Good but the bass is too low I suggest you to buy for this super smooth bass and sound quality.If you are a bass lover than upgrade to boat next level I.e price of 549 to 600.If you a smooth sound lover than this headphone is for you but if you are high bass lover than stay way.It provides you a minimum bass but a high pitch sound quality where you sometimes forgot that there was a headphone/earphone is your ear.Thank you.Love From Anik,4
I was an amazing product..very good sound quality and design.i love it so much thank u Flipkart at this price. must try this guys,5
It's really a very very very nice product I mean in this price I don't think anything else can be much better than this one... So I must recommend you guys to purchase it❤I am using it since 7months and till now it's absolutely fine.... I am sure that it will work well longer,5
good quality and good product ..i'm so happy thank you flipkart..,5
"I guess its really durable, as far as mine one is considered...I stretched it many times. Its 3 month of rough use (rough means really rough), sometimes i thought it won't work now but still its working. So according to it was a good buy i won't compare with others in the range bcoz i haven't used. Its design slightly irritates when you are sleepy and on the pillow your put your head on any one side, that time it hurts slightly but for me its totally ok bcoz it looks cool otherwise. And final...",5
Good product. Bass OK. Good sound quality and cables. boAt is best in audio. Expect good service also..,4
The earphone are great The response is great the sound quality and bass is best in this price range  Looks could be more improved as that sharp ends of earphone sometimes jet little pricky when u remove them Overall its a must buy product at this price range,5
"in this price not even a single brand is available to give a god level performance i have used so many earphones like sennhaiser ,jbl, skull candy but this earphone is best in this price range zDon't think go for it",5
Good product. Fast delivery. One day delivery. Good conditions. Good packing. Thank you flipkart,5
"Good, it meet expectations.Quality is very good as the brand is Boat.It is durable and long lasting.I love Boat product. Because of its durability and quality.",4
Overall good product for music .. bass is little bit high .. for pubg I don't recommend this earphone because of the high bass .. otherwise it's an awesome product .. u can go for it ..,3
"For better comfort  don't look at boat 225, mi basic and other redmi earphones. It is a budjet king. The quality of sound is excellent. These are made of plastic so light in weight and easily set in u r ears. The cable is soo flexible. Mera mi basic earphones 1month me karaab ho gaya, so I had given the next chance to this one.",5
I am happy with the design and colour. But the Mike quality is a bit compromised.could have been better.anyway better or best for this amount,2
I have 6 earphones right now & if I compare this to all then this is just a ordinary earphone with good sound quality with an okay design. It design is not as good as it is mentioned in the ratings it's kind of delicate.,4
Thank you so much... Nice product with affordable price and good way of delivery,5
I really like the product I really love this color of earphones it's one of my favorite one should definitely buy it as sound quality was also really nice bass is good if handled with care can be used for long time I loved my this purchase from flipkart thankyou flilkart and packaging was also good delivered in time,5

"This is an extremely good earphone from boat.... With good life, good sound quality and at an amazing price tag. I am quite happy with this purchase and will continue to trust BOAT brand for its products.",5
Great sound quality and build quality Good enough bass but not enough to hit the sweet spot,5
I think it's a nice product sound quality is pretty good also with a high quality bass and nicely designed in this price so value of money,5
It works fine with every smartphone brand but sometimes it may not be that handy while inserting in the aux hole. Also it doesn't work when connected in desktop CPU. Everything else is super nice in it.,3
"The boat weired earphones are best in all parts like sound, bass n all and flipkart has delivered in time with proper delivery venue. And the boat earphones are best. My invested money is not waste. Great experience with this earphones.",4
"Sound quality is very good , nice design, good bass .. don't expect more for this price .. Wire Quality good",5
"Loved the earphones, have 2 of them in my family, they are the best offerings from boat, love the bass and sound quality of this earphone, also lightweight with good design and build material, love the product.",5
As per the price ..very neat and fine product by boat BassHeads 💯 .fine sound ..bass is low .. ear bud small.. overall good product...,5
Best earphone in range of 399.. Bass is not as good as expected... But its almost good,5
Loved them. Great product in such a price. If someone wanna good earphones in a budget this is the best one.,4
Great pair of headphones very light and easy to carry thanks to the velcro attached. Sound quality is good bass is average but according to the price very good good and comfortable in the ears.,5
"Best in the market sound is awesome, i m a bass lover n this product is for bass lover only, it has a loud n clear sound ,regarding build quality i will give 4 star ,sound 5 star",5
very important product for me as I play pubg whole day. i loved it ♥️ and it is very excellent product... thankyou flipkart,5
Three words - Worth the money. It's simply very good and the quality is too good for this price. Just buy this if you want to have a good earphone at a normal price.,5
"These Are perfect balanced earphones.Under this price range you will get the quality and sound experience of premium Costly Earphones.It's worth ever peny buying this earphones.You Will Experience the True Sound experience with Balanced Low Mids and High Sound. Bass is Perfect and Clear Crips Sound ! Noice Cancellation Is Amazing, So You will get the immersive Surrounding Sound Quality.Just Go For It Don't Think Too Much.",5
"Well, you do not expect to get a Senheiser or a Phillips at this price range. However, the product built quality is great and the sound quality is all about clarity. No excess of bass like certain earphones offer. Tracks from legends like SOAD, Tool, Cannibal Corpse, LOG to name a few sounds pure with no exaggerated boom from the earphones. That's good...",4
The quality is fantastic and the product is best in its price. Totally a value for money product. Amazing sound quality and nise cancelation.,5
These are the best budget friendly earphone in this segment the sound is not extremely good but good considering the price and obviously the one year warranty from boat is the best part👍,1
its a awesome headphone i have ever experienced in my time thanks Flipkart fkr your wonderful valuable product.. i hope again it will give me more good n better products ahead..,5
It's really a very good earphone. Good bass also. I prefer u to go for it. The best earphone with good price....,5
very easy to handlebest in comfortand finnaly music is too good in this rangebase is little low but music is too deep and clear,5
The sound is not very loud. If u like listeningto very loud music this is not a good option.and when u put the volume at Max People around you can hear it very clearly.....not very satisfied with the performance but it looks very good and Is durable,3
"Excellent product,  good quality and nice design. I loved it.  Worth for the money.",5

It's very nice according to the price worth of buying it quality also is nice I loved it❣️❣️,5
Low budget but gives a high quality sound.. Build quality is pretty good as compere to other earphones that comes in this range. Before this earphone i used only sony company earphone and headphone... Im totally happy buying this if you're looking to buy just GO FOR IT.,5
"Using this for a few months now, satisfied for the price. Good base, it you're into such music. But it's a overall good product.",5
Sound is good and enough for normal listener But my review is only after 1 day so...i will eeit it after 10 days of use......and here is one downfall is that ...the button is only for pickups cll ....no valid for other uses like stop the running songs and pause it....over all product is good and should buy...,5
this is very good product on this price range .sound is good .design and build quality good .bass is also good,4
"What a clarity of sound,much better than my boat 225 which has excess bass,this earphone has proper bass with amazing sound quality also just go for it",5

Super product i love it and package is also very good and smart style.And last one is good for playing pubg mobile. Thank you flipkart,5
For this price range this is a baller. Though I'm not a bass lover but my mom is loving it and that's what it all about. Great work,5
Must buy. It has a very clear sound quality and its microphone is awesome for phone calls. very lightweight. fully satisfied with the service.,5
got it 332 good 1 at this price sound clearity is good bass is good design is impressive overall great product giving 4.5/5,4
"can't expect better sound quality in this price range. wire is thick, earphones feels premium. I was using mi earphones before which was of same category and now I purchased this. my experience says that this earphones has better sound quality. buy this hands down. RECOMMEND",5
a good music through a good ear phones... such nice one.. no words to tell,5
"Its a good budget option. If u really want high bass than u should go for it. Bass is okay, not too high nor too low. Sound clarity is better than even some of pricier options. I really liked the design. It would have been better if the braided kevlar wire were provided. Overall a very good quality product form BoAt. At 360 rs I do not there is any other better option.",4
this is actually the third order which I have placed . I have been using this for almost two years and just that the earphones are fine can give u the idea of robustness of the product.  further the bass and sound quality is average but considering the price range it's not too bad too. Further the mic works well and is an added advantage in this range of earphones. So go ahead in case you need a durable headset below 400. ps: got it for 365 which I think is justifiable.,4
For the given Price Range one of the best Head Phones. The sound is amazing with noise cancellation feature. Wires are tangle-free. Fits in ear perfectly and good for day to day use.,4
"first of all thanks to the seller Supercomnet and Flipkart for its lightning fast delivery. got it delivered in 12 hours of order and that is for no extra delivery charges. About product these are awesome earphones. I am a sony lover, just gave it a try got it @369. amazing bass, just a bit sharp at treble sometimes if I compare it to the soft and soothing experience of Sony but those came at 1500/- we can't compare it with a 369/- product. but trust me you wouldn't feel much difference when ...",5
nice product nice sound quality... thank you boat bass heads 100 and thank you flipkart...,5
using it for d last 5months. I really like it. d only suggestion I wud like to give is to provide sound button . otherwise it's a decent headphone,5
for 400 rs it's a great dealgood sound quality and bassgood for gaming as well(there are other options as well like realme buds2 and honor earbuds),5
Nice headphones axact which I want it's design is very stylish and bass is Impressive and sound quality is awesome. In short At This Price it is awesome.,5
it has got great sound quality and the mic is also perfect. I liked the pink colour and the hawk design.. it's worth the cost,5
"Under 400 it's good just gifted to my dad..He loves it due to it's average bass not so high..so, overall good package",4
First let me appreciate the flipkart for its fast delivery service.  I got this product in hand within 12 hrs. Headset was good and simple not that much fine with the design.,4
superb earphones with high quality bass...I gifted it to my wife...she loved it...moreover the red colour is really attractive ...thumbs up for this product..,5
quality of product is very good as per the price . best sound quality .... worth it,5
not enough bass as expected  .  sound quality is good but it doesnot offer any superior qualities from other local market available headsets. How can you call something as bass heads for a myth of the manufacturers,3
"Sounds are heareable from outside which is not good , structure is not good to use otherwise it's a very good product in this price.",4
super fast delivery and nice product thank you Flipkart team,5

Im using this head set from last 2 months and my observation is that this a very good product with good sound & good bass at a very reasonable price........go for it friend's it has 1 year warranty as well....it's a value for money...,5
"I am very impressed. Best clear bass, best sound, best quality,  overall best earphones in this price. Previously i ordered Realme buds 2 earphones but now as i compare to realme buds2 these are the best. I can compare these boAt earphones to my JBL earphones (which i use recently) bass and sound quality are similar. Thanks Flipkart 👍",5
"Amazing , fabulous product in this range,and design is super cool",5
"Looks and design of this product was pretty nice ,Sound quality was good,if u r a high volume listener better to skip this item.",4
Very nice earphones.. Looking beautiful... Super extra bass.. Extra ear buds.. Sound as FUNK.. Delivery is also on time.. Delivery agent is also good nature.. Thanku soo much flipcart,4
"A very good earphone with very good sound quality and bass, must buy. I read people saying it's is not good for musically purposes, I have no idea about it but if you want to listen good music with good bass then it is a good one.",5

"Simply put, best buy in this price range. Good sound and good build. Just go for it.",5
"the best part of this earphone is, it isn't ear paining like other brands do have. it isn't too loud, just perfect in all sector of sound qualities. Mic is clear and perfectly managing noise cancellation too",5
its nice but it is some what delicate sound quality is nice the colur is not bright as the image,4
beautiful design excellent sound clarity superb product I love it,5
"Sound quality so good and easy to use in ear 👂, soft sound 🔊..",5
. Awesome product best in value but after i replace the bud with my jbl c100si. I felt much improvement for the sound quality,5
it's reasonable but I recommend to buy during sale to get at better price and boat headphones are  really Worthy ......,4
"Good quality, good design, good performance, awesome clarity..... fully budget earphones in our price. really awesome... i love it",4
Bass is not good but okay for normal use. If you are music lover then it is not a good choice.,4

Superb performance and awesome sound quality in this price thank you flipkart to delivery in two daysAnd Thank 🙏💕 you boat,5
i ordered it 2mnth ago.  but today the right side of the earpiece is not working i dont know why. its been 2 mnth only.   6 mnths back i ordered a jbl earpiece for rs800 it was also not working  the right side of the earpiece.  i used tht for 1mnth nearly.   for keeping it in good condition i purchased a pouch also so that it lasts longer but i dnt knw after taking a proper care of it how it stops working.  very dissapointed,2
it's good for other devices but it doesn't support Redmi Note 5pro......I tried it on my phone but it didn't worked well on it,3
soud is good but it felt with less volume to me. bass 8s also decent but not as expected. nice product in its price range..Today i have been using it for 6 and a half month and now i notice that its build quality is appreciative but as other chinese earphones this too looses its output from one side🤭 now i have to buy new set.,4
it's a very good product . perfect product in this price range . it has very good sound quality. you will fell each n every instrument used n audio . bass is not that high but sufficient enough to make your day,4
"This is my second purchase of the same earphones...the first one was black and I loved the sound quality of the earphones and they were even affordable. This purchase was for my father who too loved them. So, its a wonderful product at an affordable price.",5

The best earphone ever.. very satisfied with the product quality... Not at all costly.. it fits in the ear perfectly.. It doesn't get tangled completely because of very good wires.. Very good earphone to use and suggest others too...,5
"the earphones are really good for music and watching videos, it supports 8d audio  overall they are fine but if you want earphones for games such as pubg these are not the earphones as the sound is not that clear compared to other earphones that I've  used in past the sound of footsteps's isn't  clear, that's  the reason you can't  use them for gaming, but they are pretty good for this price range and the bass is awesome. am satisfied  with the length and especially  its design loved it.",4

ok!!this is rewiew after using this headphones for more than 6 months.First of all if you are planning to buy this headphones then you must ready to use only 6 months .I found it good at its price range and from a brand like boat .But its quality is decent not that much good as boat 172 After using it for 3 months its one side haad been stopped working because of its outer coating got fully damaged.In terms of sound quality is seems to be good but does not have base in it and persoonall...,3
really good quality at this price . has a decent bass. For me the bass is great,4
Sound quality is really nice as company promise for the sake of brand image it will never disappoint you. Talking about design it has really cool funky type style and bass is also really nice not much as super extra but yess as I said not less than value for money.,4
best sound quality and best gain and best bass it can be faster delivery in two days,5
best in the market... better than Mi headphone... bass is not so good but sound quality is great... plus it has one year warranty which is great.,5
nice headset and super quality. and super sound too 😁 awesome headset. I APPRECIATE 😀👍👍👍👍👍,5
it is one of the best earphones you can buy in this price range.its bass is simply awesome .fits perfectly comes with 1 year warranty.,5
Sound quality is not too good . At starting it was good then now sound in one ear dropped . it feels very weird to listen in one air lound and another low .Price is too high.look is good.They should improve the quality of the product,3
looks wise it's so good. works properly  definitely recommend this one go for it don't think twice,4
"A good product.  Moderate bass , Great design, And great price... A definitively recommended one.",4
Fantastic headset and much delighted when I heard music. Impressive and valuable for money,5
"I bought this product about 3 months back it working amazing,It is reliable and super stronghaving good sound effects on my redmi mobile and laptop also. must buy product",5
wow very nice very nice band very nice base very good product,3
this was best headphone and it sound quality  was very amazing  I recommend  you to buy this best headphone,5
very nice headphone . very convenient to use while travelling. it reduce outside noise which i like d most.  very happy with my purchase,4
"Really an amazing product. Awesome sound, bass and design. Even the material of the wire is also good. If your budget is less then go for it. Thank you flipkart.",5
"Sound quality is not as expected. Although sound is crisp and clear but it do not have bass. I have seen reviews of this but these r not good as they were talking. And yes I m a musician so i know about sounds. I use equaliser to boost the bass and after this it work just fine. If u can't pay a penny more buy this one and if u can spend 100 more go for JBL which r way better than this, I've tries that too that's why i m saying",2
its good for the price range but not as good as other boat varieties and jbl...the design is nice but the speaker is far away from the mouth..u have to hold it close or else it wont be that audible.,3
Speaker position is not good. It would be better if its place on right side just like MI basic handsfree.,4
I HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS BEFORE BUT AFTER USING IT I HAVE BEEN GOT A GOOD V GOOD OPINION ON BOAT V GOOD SOUND QUALITY,4
"Awesome Product, Great Fit, Ample Bass and Good Quality Mic for calls...",5
sound is clear but bass is too low. I bought it reading the reviews that its bass is very good but now feeling like cheated. In one word its not that good that reviews shows..😑,2
"nice headset that you can grab with a few rupees. good sound quality and a moderate level of bass, which is worth for the amount you spend.",5
very good and cool earphones loved it a must buy product worth the money,5
The product is worth as per the price don't expect the bass to be very good it's moderate and the wires are pretty thick and rubbery feel but the sound is quite good and perfectly adjustable u can't find any earphone better than this in this price range,4
"Headset is good, good sound, having 1 year warranty card, playing pubg also is good with this, good bass best one",5
Nice built quality good vocals and super bass... Nice buy for the price,5
"Who all going to buy under Rs.400 range.this one is your perfect choice, The boat 100 has perfect sound quality and bass at this mid rang. the only thing is it's little bit uncomfortable while placing on our ears. but later it will usual.so, valuable product at under Rs.400 range. Go and buy.",4
"Don't hesitate. Good deal for the price actually exceeds expectations. However this is like for everyday use, like Skype conf calls in office, some music here and there.",5
very nice product nice bass and audio clearity and build quality is very nice i loved the item,5
With no extra earbud u will have to manage with small oneBass are moderateSound quality is good In 379 the product is goodI purchase 3 pcs due to its good wise Mic & sound,4
Superb earphones in this price range . Loved it . I would recommend to improve its bass a little more. Rest all are fine.,5
"I'm Gifted this Product to My Cute Hus .. He is really Loved it ♥  low bass , otherwise ..good ★★★★",4
"The product is awesome with great bass and sound clarity.. I liked the head set very much and it is completely worth the money. Also, it is water resistant to some extent and has an aerodynamic design",5
The product is too good at its price .. voice is clear n so comfortable.. doesnt irritates on longer use . So happy with d purchase .. best at this price . Thnkx flipcart . Product has 1 year warranty thts rhe plus point and got this for 375 rs. super happy,5
Lookwise it is pleasant due to the colour but it does not feel like a premium earphone when held. But if you are interested in spending for something that does the job and at a much cheaper price then go for it.,5
my favorite .... I am using boat headphone last 5 year .its good recommend this one ...,5
Excellent product in this budget set. Awesome bass as it named. The unique design I liked it. If you are looking at the earphone under 500 don't overthink just go with this one.,5
Well product i am happy with this earphone...sound quality well balanced and bass is balanced...value for money...on this price this product is best....go for it,5
Best earphone if you are pubg  gamer like me trust the food step sound are very clear In building or in bushes very accurate and to music it's not that much good it will be 4.1 out of 5 but for gaming it's like boomm I m so impressed I was going to buy an gaming headphone it just saved my 💰,5
quality is superior loved it and very worthy product fastest delivery in 8 Hours.,5
"It's lit! 😍. I loved this product and I recommend to buy this awsome product. overall sound quality is superb, bass is awsome. Surround sound cancellation is also good. Its gives a feel that you r attending a concert😍",5
great product build quality is good bass is great and this  price point  its a great product,5
excellent in-ear headphones.. worth the money spent. awesome sound and bass.. and thanks flipkart for the fast delivery ☺,5
"best sound, best quality, best design, I love you flipkart first delivered my order I love you and best product",5
Its really amazing ... If u want a good sound quality under normal budget then it was very best ....i got it in just 360 ..and believe me it is amazing.....,5
"After 1 day usage Bass lovers stay away from this , If you are looking for a comfortable ear phones with good ear buds then this is the best ✌",5
"I bought it some 6 months ago and these are working fine since. The build is good and the sound quality as well. I nearly use it on a regular basis and haven't found a problem at all. The shape and design is upto the mark and you also have a velcro band to tidy up the tangled wires(personally my favorite). Overall worth the money and if you have a limited budget, this can be your best option.",4
"In starting it was all well, everything works for this price range. But in my one month usage the left side buds gone off. Now it's useless. So it's on your luck if it goes all well then you won't regret.",3
"I would recommend to buy Mi headphones in same price tag. I purchased both, and clearly mi headphones are much better than this with same price tag.",2
"some bass there only you can say treble effect more.. you can buy it for normal usage like for pubg Or movie, calling if you buy it for music listening, beats, that not make sense..... if you want to buy at this price you can choose mi basic it's music effect and bass better than this boat 100 headset",4
"at this price range (got it for Rs.300) it seems very good. decent bass and treble,will not hurt ears. Also purchased JBL earphone and compared with JBL150, JBL has little more bass and treble and the price gap is more than rs.300. I expected JBL would be far better than this. so I'm happy with my purchase. mic is also functioning well.pros:good sound quality at this price rangegood for every day uselong cablecons:no flat calble",5
Such a nice headphone.Good looking and the main thing is good perfect nice bass.,5
Good one...as expected it does work according to its price.. does better job when an bass booster app is installed..liked it as i always wanted something which can compete Samsung's earphone and got it,5
its working nice and very excellent shape super comfortable headset for ears,4
"it comes with a great price point of 379 and additional 1year of warranty which is good . sound quality is also good . happy with that . And I am more happy that they are offering a free little pouch which is so adorable at this price bracket . Overall , great purchase .",5
the quality of the headphones is up to the mark and the best thing about this headphones are they fit into your ears very comfortably and the fitting is just excellent bass is also great when u want to hear music or raps or any party song but the actual problem is when u want to hear silent or calming songs the headphone tends to produce unrequited bass so it quites irritates I would recommend this headphones to u if u want build quality and excellent fitting but if your someone who tends t...,5
if you are buying this product under 400 than you must buy it is worth every peny quality of the product is nice according to 400 price range I have got total 3 same product for my sisters too and they also liked it very much.,3
It is good.It gets excellent bass it high sound.But bass is low sometimes.Sometimes it does not fit in the ear.But it is good earphones.It is avery good earphone at this rate.,5
Awesome headset I've stopped using local headphones after this boat it's very decent with crisp and clear deep bass,5
"Bass is good but sound clearity is no so good ,I would prefer go for another model of boat.",4
The best budget Headphone u can get at this price point... if you compare its functionality according to its price then this is the best headphone you can get right now in the market..,5
An earphone worth to buy. It has a very nice bass and gives soothing sound effect to the ears. I purchased it one month ago and I am writing the review after one month of using it. It's sound balancing quality is also very nice. Overall it's a nice product.,5
The first day I got it and found that it's awesome with it's clearity of sound. it's a budget headset with a premium quality. great purchase. thank you boAt.,5
Not the best quality earphones even for this price. i paid 350. would suggest jbl for better sound quality. the default sound is horrible and irritating. the high treble by default might make your ears bleed on high volume. need to reconfigure using equalizer and increase the bass. idk why they've named this bassheads after all. but now it's good after adjustments on equalizer. build quality is good. even better than what jbl provides at this price range.,3
Very good product at this rangeYou should definitely buy it...if your budget is low and you want a good earphone this is perfect for you,5
"It's quite satisfying. Having good build quality. come under the budget. Okay, Bass. It works fine for a few months subsequently, the quality gets reduced.Alternative: If you have a better budget then go with Boat nirvana bliss.",3
good quality with good Price.... u can afford easily.... and can maintain good for long time,4
sound quality 5/5bass 4.5/5design 5/5crystal clear sound quality.. bass is superr but not heavy as 225..comparing with mi baisics  boat 100 is super ..with crystal clear quality of sound...,5
"Good product, worth of money. But bass is heavy so not clear sound. Sound is outside of ear",5
awesome earphones .... with good sound quality .... and for games ... it is the best earphones for me having without base ... which is nice for gamers ...🔥🔥🔥,4
wow ...these are amazing headphones with the best sound quality and bass ... loving it ...thanks boat,5
Product is nice but plastic made doesn't feel good in hands. Bass is very good but sound quality is 7.5 out of 10.,4
"perfect one for music lovers.. Amazing bass and treble was also good.. loving it.. its a budget range gadget, I recommend it to everyone..",5
boat headset are perfect and I am check out sow sounds quality  perfect best bass best sound volume and best designs and prefect color sow I am happy 😊,5
Not bad. Worth for temporary use as well worth for money also. After starting to use we will knew the real part.,3
very good sound quality....bass type smooth ..but overall its a good profuct in 399..I like it very much,5
"an original boat earphone was received by me..good sound quality and IT SUPPORTS ALL KIND OF PHONES LIKE XIAOMI, ASUS,VIVO,OPPO, SAMSUNG. PERSONALLY I HAD BOUGHT THIS EARPHONE FOR ""ASUS ZENFONE LITE L1"" AND IT IS SUPPORTING VERY WELL. I AM HAPPY WITH BOAT N THANKS FLIPKART AND TEAM",5
"This earphone is one of the good ones in this price range. The sound is fine and if you want a deep rich sound, please go for higher quality earphones. It is to be noted that the 3.5mm pin is not right Angled, other than that everything seems to be fine",4
Does the job...... I think the only Indianbrand meeting the expectations. Bass is good sound quality is good but not crystal clear as used to be around in 2008-9 earphones which we can't get today but worth for the price.,4
"Awesome product , i got pink colour earphones for my sister and black coloured for myself . Good quality voice , nice bass , nice built up , good design , durable",5
"It is a nice product, good sounds and stylish look and it is suitable for budget",5
Using this since 6 month. Not any problem at all. Very good product. I recommend that to buy. Good product with reasonable price. I really like it.,5
wow... this is awesome products.... and sound quality... pretty good according to my choice of music... I think it doesn't show high bass... which is good for me as I don't like... and ya the delivery boy was so nice as his behavior was good and I got this on time... thank you flipkart.. just loving it...,5
close ur eyes and go for it. best budget headphone. i have used it roughly for 6 months. still no issues. going well like brand new.,5
"This headset stylish very nice and laught of sound effect and very powerful clear sound so, very wonderful good products thank you filpkart.",5
Superb Earphone From Boat..  Got It At An Amazing  Price Of 349/- Only..  Loved It..  Specially The Pink Colour..  Thank You Flipkart..,5
"it's a very good earphone in a very reasonable price and of course it's a boat which is a trustworthy brand but only thing by which I am not very much satisfied is it's bass , it's sound is very clear but quite low but not bad it's a very very good earphone,, everyone should try this once,, Loved it 😘😘😘",4
I am using this head phone since last 2 months. it is good not best sounds quality is nice but as named boAt bassheads. I didn't get bass. so give 4 star.,4
it's been only one day since I got it..so it is working perfectly fine. sound quality is good. bass also working fine. hopefully it will work like this for an year. design is also perfect. I got it for for 389 bucks so worth for the money I paid.,4
"Sound quality is good and bass is also cool and extra ear buds are also provided but the wire quality is not good,it is very thin.Overall quality of the product is good within this price but BOAT should do something about the wire quality otherwise it is all good.",4
"it's really worth product to purchase, the quality of the product is good ,and it has good and pleasant voice quality just loved it",5
1st of all this is not a chargable product it is true wired earphones and its packaging material and product making material all is good and sound is just wow at this price with the bass you loved it believe me but at once youu won't disappointed with this product 100% i am sure i am enjoying music and movie every day 2hr at least  and it sounds good. Thanquuu boat to giving me such or5oduct at cheap price....🙏🙏,4
BOOM. This headset is just perfect in the price segment. Superb Sound Quality and good build. Always been fan of boAt and this brand never disappoints. Got it around 349 during BBD and I guess that should be the price for the product. For sure one can buy these.,5
"Design is awesome, product is good and well packed ,sound & bass quality is also good, I am really happy from this product buy from flipkart,just say that I am really awesome & enjoyed.",5
this is very good product.sound quality lis good . but buds are not well to the ears.,5
Good one nyc sounds. Audio quality is best for this price. If you looking for bass go for MI headset at same rate. Best for gaming,4
nice product...but the bass is not upto the mark...looks are very nice...noise cancelation is good ....overall a good buy in this price,4
ok. honest review. these headphones are very good looking no doubt! good and clear sound. But almost no base and depth. I bought two headphones this one and mi basic earphones. mi gave me better sound quality and bass than this. in some songs without the bass(even if it's light) you won't enjoy listening to it. hope boat bassheads 100 will be durable enough coz I use my headphones roughly.,4
"Obviously, the bass is not very in line with more better products of Boat, but this one is a good proxy if you have a low budget. Also, the design is very cool to look at",5
"I bought these headphones on a discount . Thankfully these are value for money . You can easily listen to music or watch series/movies even at a lower volume since the sound quality is excellent.  the bass is good but could be improved . If you are looking to buy headphones that are not too expensive but has better long-lasting quality  , I would suggest this brand . However - and this goes for every headphones of every brand out there in the market- it would be wise to regulate the use of he...",5
Nice  products but sound and bass quality vary vary good product. Good looking . so beautiful and sound quality good,5
"Excellent Base and ClarityI am writing this review after using this product for 1 month. Considering the price, the headphone has very good base and voice clarity. It seems like the person is standing next to u when u r talking with someone. Listening music is a great experience. If u listening some heavy base and musical songs, u can't listen in full volume for a long time. Overall extremely satisfied with the product.",5
Very great headset at this price and the build of it is amazing because I use it roughly everyday and it works very well.,4
This is awesome headphone sound is very clear.for more better quality you can plug it to laptop sound quality is mind blowing.  its been 3 months I'm using it roughly but its working properly.if you want a earphone for travel purpose this will be the best choice.,5
Probably one of the best earphones i had used in a while the build looks not very good at first but after a whole year of usage all the stuff they earphones have gone through its a pretty good and sturdy pair of earphones with too good sound quality for that price and is loud enough to isolate yourself in public surroundings one of best purchases i hg made on this website as a whole,5
firstly it is a good product... It has really clear sound from other headphone in this range...Though it's build quality is not up to the mark but it's sound quality compensates that.....It's bass quality is good....lastly within this 400 range it is the best headphone for every one.....,5
It is a good product. Nice sound quality but not for my expectation. The looking of the product is pretty good.,3
Pros- 1)The sound loudness is great. 2) Mic quality is great and calling quality also. Cons- 1) Bass is just horrible. 2) Built quality is also not ok. 3) At this price range more earphones are there which are far better than this 4) Earbuds are too small......overall i will not suggest to buy this product.,3
Nice but not good enough to satisfy my expectations 😏,4
it's awesome but there is no enough bass to get satisfied...so it's good for regular use and build quality is good value for moneyppp0,3
👍👍👍Ordered in FEB 19 using since then headphones are very good they are with great SOUND quality the BASS is moderate All vocals & Tunes are also very clever Overall very good performance and VALUE FOR MONEY  peice it is ❤❤❤,4
"been 7months of daily usage , no complaints at all the product is working super fine even after rough use ! I would say this Would be the best buy for this price range !The sound quality is good base is good (not great) but hey for this price i would say its the best !",5
400 Rs It really worth it. I heard some songs and bass and sound quality is very nice and build quality is awesome,3
Not so good.. Mi basic earphones are better choice in this range.. I have used both and the Mi earphones impressed me than this Boat bassheads 100.. Thank you....,3
Good quality... Worth it... Go for this earphones in such good price... And price will fluctuate wait for it... I buy this product for 370,5
"Brought this for 325 which is quite a decent price.let's come to the point, Boat is a good brand and it gave all to you in below 400 rupees segment.pros - Heavy Bass, Loud Sound, cons - Audio jack doesn't work at times, Wire quality is average.",3
is a good product..but failed to work after 4 months... warranty was for a year...but still satisfied because it worked great for me for 4 months,4
"Ideal for those who like to listen to music with more bass. The design of the ear piece is good and it fits perfectly. Good for listening to music, but not ideal for movies, the extra bass makes it uncomfortable to listen subtle dialogues  and slow scenes. Overall this is a good product",4
BOAT HEAD PHONE IS VERY NICE AND SOUND AND BASS VERY NICE THE HEAD PHONE IS GOOD PRODUCT VERY VERY GOOD THANK YOU FLIPKART.,5
best headset from boat in budget. I like it so much. it is too durable. it's sound quality is too good in this price. it give clear voice. also thankful to Flipkart for better delivery.,4
good quality ..nice smooth bass..i give rating..4.5 out of 5..because price should be 250-300 is good for this product..and good quality of wire..and i love the design..any way good one..,4
well it's good sound quality but the earphone is  not correctly fitting my ears everytime i put the ear phon in my ear after will be slipped right back well that is a big problem,3
Grt product within this range and always look for offers and buy it... good bass and clear sound... listening to songs is great with this... whoever has borrowed it frm me has given a good feedback after listening the sound and music output... should buy...,5
"If you are looking for decent earphones under 400 Rs. then these are the best out there. Been using for over 2 months haven't faced any issues. Some equaliser settings (choose Bass Genre) could be done to improve bass quality. No cons in specific, great deal to avail if available on/under 400.Edit: I filed for replacement when one of the earphone bud stopped working because of harsh use. The entire hassle-free process of replacement took 15 days but I ended up with completely new ones. High...",5
"Nice purchase at this price. Lightweight and stunning design. Sound clarity is good enough in this price range. Peoples looking for a good one in this budget, must check this out.",5
"nice product, nice sound, nice bass, good design, GO FOR IT",5
it's a very gud qualit earphone. very handy to use and the sound is awesome everything is great actually it's worth it👍👍👍👍,5

good one nice sound and clarity in reasonable price,5
"This is the best product I have ever purchased from Flipkart, it has good sound quality with bass which make you street dancer for a while, even I have started dancing when I wear the boat headphone..  #Reliable#Budget. All this in just awesome price 399",5
The Earphones are excellent. The sound quality is excellent too. They comfortably fit too so a great purchase for me! Received in just 2 days after placing order. Bass is good and vocals too. With some equalizer setting they sound extremely well! Must go for this one!,5
design is good but sound quality is not good.so guys in the same price range you may purchase mi head phone. the same will better not only better but also the best in the same peice,5
Good product for Rs 400. The best part is u can claim online warranty provided by boat. Got my boat basshead 100 replaced free of cost under 1 month... Boat is definitely worth iy,5
got earphone with good equality design and soundI really trust this brand and price is also good compared to other brands and after market service is betterAnd The best part is it comes with 1 years replacement warranty4/5,4
One of the best earphone in this price range. It has great sound with good bass but the clarity of sound is not that much as expected.,4
expected better than it is . good but you can make it more good boat .,4
enchanting and safe packed one.best quality and bass sound... i like it.... superb for this rate,4
A good Product on this price. Good Built Quality. Useful for normal users or ordinary people. Not good for those who wish for high bass.,4
Really cool looking earphones. Loved the design.. But the bass is not that punchy.. It's just normal bass. I feel like my JBL earphones have better bass than these. Sound quality is not that bad.,4
"Best quality earphones, awesome looks, great base, and light weight, so much better than other earphones in it's price range.",5
this is my first lead of boat but this lead is very good and I like sound of this lead,5
A decent headphone for everyday use. You can't expect much in this price range but it will amaze you by its sound quality. The build quality is also good considering its price point. Go for it if you have budget around 400rs.,4
"Very good quality with this price range , and build quality is ok and delivery is very fast on this product .. pretty impressive 😁",5
"Superb man Nothing is better than this boat as for its value for money ..😉Sound , bass everything is perfect .You'll love it",5
good product and a good looking this is a valuable price at a valuable cost and good base and good sponsor Guru randhawa best singer and a good quality thank you but wonderful product,5
"Premium quality product.I was tried all big brands like sony , philips , JBL etc but boat providing very premium sound quality with very efficient price.if you want a great quality product, MUST BUY...",5
simply awesome and pretty too. the sound quality is better than any earphones at this price. flexible wire makes the assembly much better. no chance of tearing up in these wires. pink colour is dedicated to girls. But anyone can go for this @400,4
"In this price range, this is one of the best earphone available on flipkart, design is so nice, sound and bass is also very good. and this all is from one of best  brand.",5
"cool , so comfortable and stylish I love it",4
awsome quality sound like a Sony speaker bass is really good and one benefit is 1 year warranty,5
"Received yesterday(07.08.19). Good packing and on time delivery by Flipkart, Thanks for that . Head phone is very light in weight . Ear beads are too small . They provide different sized ear bushes . L shaped pin not available but in the same segment MI is providing that . Bass is very low and flat but the voice is clear . Average build quality . No volume controls are available . Good for normal calling purposes .",3
"These earphones are designed at its best with good bass and very good sound clarity, and worth the money. A perfect gift for my parents. Thank you Flipkart.",5
"I have the boat rockerz 255 sports wireless headset, and I have been using it for a month now. On comparing the bassheads to the rockerz, first of all,  the bassheads is more comfortable than the rockerz, but it has negligible bass as compared to the rockerz. The sound quality is comparable, and is at par with other earphones like Sennheiser cx-275s, jbl, etc. Overall, it is a really good earphone in this price range.",5
great value for money... you can trust boat to deliver decent sound not amazing but great for this kind of money,5
I recommend JBL compare to this earphone. JBL is little costlier but can play all types of music on any device. Boat works fine when it's DJ Remix etc but not that great to listen to soul soothing songs. Like peaceful romantic songs by Arijit Singh. I bought JBL C150si for Rs 699/- after wasting my money on this boat Bassheads 100.,4
best in class. affordable with 1 yr warranty. built quality is great. best for gifting purpose. pure bass and good noise cancellation.,5
"its a good product , its sound quality is good but bass is okay ...if you have audio systm setting in mobile then you will have a good audio by changing its treble and bass .. ITS WORTH FOR 354 RUPEES",3
very good product in low range. sound is very good. if you are bass lover then go for another one. It has a bass but not good one but as compare with prize is very very good ✌️  But really nice one in very low range,4
Good quality... Color is pretty good love it,5
It's a good option if your on a tight budget. It works fine for me.,5
"Got this for Rs 375, with fast delivery. Overall Sound is good. Bass is not great but it's ok. Mic also works fine. Comfortable with ear. Build and wire quality is good. If you want earphone for regular use and want an less budget earphone then this is perfect for you, definitely go for it. Plus it comes with one year warranty.",5
"Its an awesome piece man. at this price range even sony one cannot beat it. Surprised by its sound, boat knows its platform. Quality is also durable, good quality rubber so cables do not get messed up. Just one line, Awesome sound delievered. Go for it. At this price range, you not gonna find anything better than this.",5
wow this. at this price it worth a headset of 1000rs's one lovely headset good bae and very good sound quality,5
"1.Value for money 2. Best product, clear audio, clear bass Nice product",5
"original price is around 400,dont go for it if its above 400.They pretty fit well in ears,bass to high that it interrupts the song itself.coming to quality its good and worthy",5
"i am an audiophile, I tested it with many ear phones I have and it is not that good as is told by others. It does not have punchy beats, voice is more evident and background instruments are some what feel artificial and beats feel artificial too very artificial ear phones. I personally prefer natural beats and instrument sound to feel the same energy as the composers and singers experienced. I did not like it, very artificial.",2
The sound is good and clear at this price range. Design is unique and is compatible with iPhones as well 👍,5
this is very good sound quality. and good design comfortable with ear. also very good delivery boy is right time delever my home delivery...,4
Sound quality is super clear and it's just mind blowing 😍😍😍 If you love bass then it is perfect for you. It is good for talking also.,5
sound quality nice. design are good color is good altogether good product. worth buying. Happy with the product.?,4
The earphones are really good..... I m very much satisfied with the product.... I have been using it for 5 months and I really love it.... Worth the price ..... Just go for it.....!!!!,5
"Good for bigeners ! Definitely not for the ones who love to have high bass but offcourse voice is clear, so as mic, design is excellent, overall a good purchase",5
pretty neat setup.sounds good with descent bass and good treble.the mic seems a bit far and the other person complains of having less volume on call via the mic. Rest all good!,5
Thought it'll be normal as i got it for low price...but the bass and beats and sound effect... Different ...well designed and unique style....good comfort and best quality.... I got this price for 499.... And i love boAt,5
This is the best earphone available in the market for this price. Boat is the best as of now.,5
"best in class,  and it's truly worth it. and is this prize simply superb product with ample amount off bass.",5
The bass is great compared to other earphones. The design and build quality is just awesome. And the earbuds are so comfortable they smoothly adjust in your ears.,5
my previous boat 220 slipped from ears often and it lasted  only a year. first the mic didn't work anymore and the following week the left earpiece got damaged too :( This boat 100 has better sound quality but bass is less than that of 220 but its fine. earphone fits perfect and it does not slip down like 220. I'm satisfied.,4
i liked it very much. bass is low and didn't like the built quality that much. but it is a good buy.,4
If you are looking a stylish earphones than this product is made for you. It's bass quality isn't so good but when you listen at a low volume you will get a  good quality sound & lilttle bit of bass which is just fair to the price that you pay. But when you talk about the packaging it's impressive they deliver to you with a very safety processe that what is needed.,2
They're baby pink & so girly I love that about these & also these look so chic. Sound quality & all is good for the price I would not say extraordinary though. But one thing I've identified is that these are easily slipping off my ears I should change the buds to fit right in. They give you 3 sizes of buds to go with and the medium size one comes prefixed. summed up it's value for money,4
Its a beast in this price segment. It is the best in-ear headset under 400. It has the best built quality as well as great sound quality with awesome clarity and bass. M using this headset since last 5 months and I am really satisfied with its performance.,5
redmi basic is a way better product redmi has sealed box which you have to tear at the opening to get to the product it's heigenic and trustworthy this one has good sound clarity I guess,3
Boat is always a good brand and it's products are good and this is also good.......love it ... thank you .....,5
top notch performance by this headset if your a bass lover then it will be a better choice .,5
ok product... the wires are too thin..nice brand so better go with the sturdier ear cord... it is durable,3
"Sound quality is good , but it has low bass .. so if you love bass don't buy it otherwise the product is good ...I had this earphones and it worked for 10 months and after that it stop working .. but if you will handle it with care then surely it will last for 1-2 years ..",4
I like the look of this earphones. As the name says it's bass is awesome and even the sound quality is nice. I totally recommend this earphones.. value for money!❤️,4
"super product, in a good price, bass and sound quality is wonderful to listen, i m totally satisfied after buying this. Delivery was fast also within 3-4 days. Thank you...",5
"As per my point of experience, the overall quality of the earphones is good for normal song jamming and calls. It indeed does provide some base for improving the listening experience but its, not the bass quality you get in the expensive headphones. I would highly recommend these earphones for those who like listening to songs and attending calls on most situation.",3
"mind blowing purchase superb brilliant job flipkart... I 😍 love it so much.., I like flipping.... 😍😍😍😍😍go for it guys for value of the money...",5
I love the sound.  Thanks flipkart for selling such an amazing product in such a reasonable price. I am so happy with the product.,5

sound is good .. bass is also good ... build quality is Okk... in this price range it's a good choice,3
the headphone is not that great as compared to price point and the bass isn't that great and treble is not also great but if u want a headphone just for casual things like for calling then go and after some time it pains in the ear,3
"OH MY GOSH ,THIS HEADSET IS LIKE SUPER DUPER GOOD. THE SOUND QUALITY AND THE BASS IS LEGIT . 10 OUT OF 10. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT .",5
This earphone are really good for daily usage. Those who love to listen podcasts and voice contents this earphone provide accurate sound and very clear peach. Bass is normal.,5
A very good to buy within  Rs 400. Decent bass quality and nice clarity of sounds.,4
"Nice headphones and good bass, good for normal uses and daily use. I use it daily for travelling and etc....so far so good.",5
"I am overall satisfied with this product. Good build quality, comfortable with the ears, unique design, bass is also decent when it comes to earphones. While wearing these, it would not mute the surroundings completely which is a positive aspect of earphone products.",5
this product is worth for what we spend on it 399/- it is working pretty good I am using it from last 3months,4
sound was really good & jst  like the product & it was wonderful experince thank u flipkart,5
best headphones . bass and clear crystal sound but only long lenth length of wire you have to adjust all the time but other wise go for it,5
This Product Is Good . It Is Not Good For Too Bass Songs It Only Gives Clear Voice..Good For Pubg Players,5
Superb earphones.Very good quality and sound is excellent as per price.Cables are pretty thick and strong.Using it for the past 6 months on regular basis no problems faced yet.Excellent performance and bang on value for money.,5
"They are actually kinda awesome or fantastic , the bass is high and you can get a good experience using these.",5
The bass is very good for this range. I think boat has given the pricing correctly. The build quality is good and it's stylish. The length of the cable is good. It had a 1 year warranty card too with the box. It was a best buy.,4
"the best product at this low range ,brought this @ only 379 n experience is quite good , bass is clear n the trble is upto the mark n best experience while watching movies",5
"Very nice design,I liked it very much so much nice soundClear soundVery nice bassComfortable in ears",4
it has a very clear sound. design is also very impressive .it has a good bass. i used it since 2018 october. its worth money,5
"Boat bassheads 100 is a good earphone but if you are looking for good and high bass then don't buy this. The apt will be boat bassheads 225 for high quality sound. This earphone gives a mild sound which is apt for listening to classical, instrumental and vocals only. I ordered this and now I am returning it.",3
at price of 375 build quality is good ... audio quality is good ... I'm using it with real me 3 .bass is also good music lover and pubg players will love it,5
"In short, great. Bass is superb with a nicely tuned equilizer. I've provided the ratings just not keeping in mind the price, but it actually performs. Only thing I found not suitable for me is the output is more on treble side in general. To give an example, if you're familiar with Poweramp, I use Bass and Treble preset. With this earphone, I used Bass Extreme to get relative output. However, this perspective is compared to Xtra Bass earphones from Sony. This is not an issue with a good equil...",5
Absolutely superb at this price point. Don't think just buy. Very very comfortable not slippery like any plastic earphone. This item don't need any review. Love it.,5
Build quality is good but sound nt like that much to you expecting.. Still in this price it's quite good,3
Good quality earphone in a limited budget.... Quality is good... clear audio .... bass is okaish.... not something outstanding....Build quality is also good... Overall a good product in a affordable price,5
"I must say this is the best headset available in the market right now ... design and build is just awesome , talking about the sound quality it is very good , for this price point Mi and boAt is very close , i use both headset but I like the boAt one.",5
Great productAt this range this is an superb product. The quality of the sound is too good and the build quality is also fantastic,5
"If you are lover of ""Bass Boosted"" earphones this is not for you, if you are music lover like traditional music it is for you.",3
"Probably the best earphone for under 499rs.Bass is remarkable, mic is flawless, wire is superb quality.Just one drawback, it has a simple jack.Mi earphones provide a L-shape connector for safety, but they lack in bass which this earphone excels in. If ur looking for earphones under 500rs price, kindly go for this one.",5
Amazing product considering the price point. I have been using earphones starting from the days when I used to carry a walkman with me every where I went. Best buy for me since the pricey brands which I used to purchase spending over 5k on my audio cravings.Trust me I cannot appreciate boAt for delivering such an amazing product at a throwaway price. Kudos to u guys and flipkart too for all the additional discounts and insane delivery time.,5

"Everything is good and fine, product is awesome,  but my experience on the whole headset ,is that I feel the edge of ear device should be bit renew rather than a sharp edge finishing,  which doesn't feel comfortable inside the helmets and skull caps.",4
"sound is good but not too loud. bass is just ok okproduct's finishing is poor, cut marks can clearly be seen... please go for other one... not recommended",3

The sound quality is really nice, the bass, treble and all the background sounds are clear.2. The cable length is good.3. Good quality plastic is used, so it seems to be durable.4. The mic is good, all the calls that I took with it was clear.5. Perfectly fits in the ear due to its 45 degree tilted earpiece.And now the most important thing...",5
this product is amazing nice build quality nice bass nd sound but i not impress with the flipcart delivery service .,5
Sound quality of these earphones is awesome at this price. Great build quality and Packaging is good too. Definitely worth a try!!!,5
Bass Is Normal Nothing To 32 OHM Quality Please Need To Improve in Future.. Firstly I Recommended For You Build The Sensitive Sound Quality Because That's Best Of Things Try It Thank You,5
product is good with price is little bit high the showing 399 but it taking the 499 I don't know how this one but it is not good thank you Flipkart.,5
"It's comparable to MI Basic headphone though not perfect.pros:1. mic quality is excellent2. button is clicky and very useful. one press for pause double press for next long press for GA3. length is good4. the boAt sticker cloth is lovely.5. bass is good enough6. sound quality is also goodcons:1. the ear buds aren't soft and can hurt your ears at times2. build quality could be better3. I prefer the ""L"" shape over the 3.5mm headphone jack. You won't get that here",3
it's amazing Headset by boAt and fast delivery by Flipkart with buying Flipkart by later.....and I am really happy with this by Flipkart,5
I have recieved this product Boat basshead 100 everything is good very light weight and a brand u can go for it value for money But bass is little bit low it means only balanced not too much as you need...but good as compare to any local earphone.u can believe on boat build quality...,3
best earphones at this price range super base superb clarity and nice build quality awesome earphones with one year warranty,5
"i like to have it.. it's really good, i am happy after buying this. Thank you flipkart.",5
Awesome sound quality great base. The size of earbuds are small as compared to others but somewhere it's a plus point with a negative one too.wire quality is superb. No issues with it. about the sound quality it honestly reduces the outer sound so you would be happy ignoring the world and getting into your own .Value for money guys. I would recommend it to you. rough and tough ✌️,5
"Nice earphones , I have brought two at 750 Rupees . Nice packaging from Flipkart , It consists of Warranty card and extra earbuds also. Overall package is good . I am impressed",4
Awesome bass at this price range! Fits well in your ears. Comes with two sized ear buds. Best in range.,5
Amazing sound quality.... But for some of the songs the voice is more tribble and the bass is getting slightly lower... So please check that.... Other than that evary thing is perfect and also bulid style is superb but the length for microphone is very far from mouth to speak u should minimise the length.... That's it boat is a very gud product.... I was really satisfied with the quality of the product....,5
awesome quality headset keep the good work flipkart. packaging is awesome love the product,5
"very nice product from boat at A very reasonable price. nice built and body and the mic has a good coverage. i also have Boat Stone 260 bluetooth speakers, all my boat experience is very good and loved BOAT devices.",5
Is works like normal earphones. No extra bass quality in it. Ik it has warranty but still 4 months me kharab hua .. like seriously man? I have to contact customer care. Not good for music lovers at all. Must check all reviews before buying.,2
this was the best earphones but this is not great as mi basic build quality is not good because it's built with plastic about sound quality sound quality is good but bass is bass was very high bass distrubing vocals,3
The Best in class in this segment The Best thing is the Build qualityBass is Not excellent But really goodThe quality is AwesomeI am extremely satisfied by this one,5
would recommend very good built quality and also the bass is good more over at this price it's really amazing I would say,4
This is a wonderful headset. The most good headset  I have used.It gives preference to bass. Sound clarity is not too bad.Company gives two more eartips which are very useful.This product will lead to a unique world where there is only you and your track.I feel good with this product.,4
It's a good earphone within this price list 😅....but if you are listening to classical music..... You'll not be able to hear clear audio 😅.....but bass is good 🤗,5
Worth of money good product good quality sound effect good,4
"Boat can be taken as an alternative to MI basic wired headset and both and awesome product at this line of price. best time to buy is during the sales that you can expect an additional 20/30 rupees discount. Eventhough all the performance base is perfect, the wired part is little thinner than MI and can have easy breakage issues.",4
"Awesome sound, great bass and perfect balance for rock music and bass song lover",5
"I think that is good but when I receive this item it was very very good...I totally satisfied this product.... awesome sounds, but bass are low but althing is good.....I just love it💖💖💖",5

"at this price its better than many boat earphones that comes at higher price rangeIts more comfortable in ear, sound quality is good and even talking on phone using mic is having no issues.",5
One of the best earphones that you can buy online...best quality of sound with great clarity but at the same time bass is very average.,4
Looking for the perfect headphones ?  Then this product is definitely a must buy for you. The sound quality and especially it's design and build up is awesome. I'm totally in love with this product. Thanks Flipkart for selling this amazing product at very reasonable price.,5
This is soo amazing at the price. It is worth every penny. It looks very premium has good sound quality and the mic is working perfectly fine. At this pricing I think this is the best one.,5
"super bass, sound and design. Very cool and comfortable to ears. Good quality.",4
good earphones...sound is good bass is nice but when volume is full it's too much heavy to bear..overall nice earphone for 350 rs..I'm satisfied,5
"In comparison with mi basic earphones i give it 3star as mi earphones are more comfortable than it..the earbuds of mi earphones are softer n mi does not make u feel pain while using it for long hours. Plus mic is also at it's right place, exactly next to ur mouth, in mi basic earphones but in boAt earphones you'll have adjust the mic",3
The quality is too good. Sound is very nice. But the bass is not coming upto mark. Even it is a nice product with this price range. If you have random usgae like in travel and walking other areas go with this as it is good product with reasonable price.,4
wonderful sound effect. it is worth the money & pocket friendly too. it is awesome for music lovers.I love it,5
"The product is obviously awesome in looking and its sound quality also great but somehow it's design is not perfect .Wearing this headphone will surely give you ear pain .It is not from the music, it is for the build fault .I recommended to purchase boat basshead 225 with 💯 more money .",4
The product looks attractive and quite good in sound also for daily normal use it's good and it some time available in various type Like IPL cricket league versons if you prefer those,5
I thought the bass will be good but it is hear like stereotype why I don't know. but delivery is good with safe packaging,4

base is good voculs are nice and crisp are also good,4
let me try to be objectivethey are normal earphones with mic.no way to identify left and right quickly and the marking is too small to fund. the plugs fit in but are not comfortablethe bass is just horrible.voice clarity is good.not worth the price. thought boAt was making good qaulity. I haven't tried their higher prices ones but this does not make sense,2
"See at Price point of 400,Nothing Can Be better than this..built quality is better than Skull candy and Jbl of Price range around 600-700..and Over all sound quality is good",5

Sound is good enough... i found it avearage earphone... although i bought another earphone from the local market in the aame price range was better than this. after a usage of one week right side stopped working but boat gave a free replacement within 10 days. kudos to boat team and overall good performance... that's why i am giving a less star.,4
I had ordered it for my friend and he's really happy with these beacuse he had used it before. According to him the bass is good and soung quality is great in tge price range of 350,4
Very good earphones with good durability amd sound clarity but the bass boost is a fir flat but overall its great,4

far better than expected.Mind-blowing product at this very price.looks very stylish and far better than 600/- Sony headphones.optimum wire length so no problem of getting tangled.Salute to the sound quality at this price. Believe me no one is going to give you something so good at this very price.buy it with your eyes closed. I guarantee you won't regret.,5
Guys simply put  its just the best earphone under 400...its sound quality is so charismatic that I'll strongly recommend u to buy this... don't think just go for it guys.. is just a monster..,5
giving this review after using for more than 5 months...very good product...build qualtiy is also very good...this is the only headphone which lasted so long...its wire qualtiy and ear buds qualtiy is also good cuz of which i would say this is the best headphone ryt now in the market!!!,5
It's bass is Preety nice but after taking it to Max you would get a hizz Or you can say high pitch annoying sound which is definitely not Acceptable. Would recommend you to take only when you have a budget of 400 and if you don't have any budget problem then go with the JBL earphone they have more bass and sound enhancer like stuffs inbuilt in earphones. That's all for my experience after using it.I would definitely not happy with the naterialy they used in this Price as it could be more bett...,4
"i was looking for a budget friendly earphone with decent sound quality. to my surprise the sound quality of this earphone is much better than h have expected under this price tag, i would say its a best earphone than any other you can get for double it's price.",5
"Lovely design. The sound quality is good as well, instead I would say the volume quality is great and has a high capacity but I believe it would've been better if the bass quality was high. However, these earphones are pretty great if you want a decent set of earphones under less budget.",5
I am a bass person. Not very good but good enough for a casual listening to music or conversation. A very good value for money product.,4
fanatstic sound .at this range got for 350 ...its a worth   ..if ur range is 350 400 ...blindly go for this cons --- bass is bit down. but beautiful thing is clarity 100% ..no compromise.. but bass is also avergae,5

"Good product, Headset wire is better than other headsets, Nice to use, Sound effect are good for the price range",5
"A surprisingly good earphone with great sound quality in this budget. The earphones are also pretty comfortable in your eyes, definitely the thing for long hour usage. It' is an amazing buy. The only problem is not so good bass, but can't be a deal breaker in this price segment.",5
awesome earphones good bass n clear sound n fit properly to ear.but from right side earpiece sound is not coming properly. within 2month product got damage,5
Nice product on this prize sound is good bass is also good,4
nice product in this range. good design and quality. but it can be better a little bit. range wise good selection but if u r a music freak then choose some better option.,5
"I was looking for a good headphone in reasonable price, surfing through the Flipkart and come across this product. After viewing some reviews and rating, I got me a chance and booked it in 389/-. By 4 days I got my delivery, packaging was great and headphone was non disputed. The product is as good enough than my expectation. sound clarity is remarkable and noise cancellation works tremendous in it. lastly I will say if you are looking for a good quality branded daily use headphone along with...",4
this is a good budget earphone I purchased it at 350 and it is total worth it at this price rate .👍sound is average👍build quality is is average👍bass is good👍up 400 rupee price it is good👍 compare to mi basic earphone it is good,3
Just go for it. I used mi  price of 399/- but that stooped working within month. this boat heads working like charm.. Amazing clear sound nd bass.. at price of 349/-,5
Nice product don't think that it has plastic body it is having nice build quality. Sound quality awesome i had tried on pubg also it feels like dolby atmos.,5
When i used for 1st week everything was best and better But now bass and sound quality is not as first i used. with in 2 weeks quality was poor. But it's not happen to every earphone depends on what qualitie you get. Go for it best earphone.,5
Product was good design and packing are good. But not felt like bass and sound quality are great compared with other boat headphones. The sound quality is normal.,4
the best product in it's segment......soon soothing sound and powerful and clear bass that u can feel! just wow.....and tq Flipkart as I received the product 4 days before the delivery date!,5
WELL PACKED.WELL OUTLOOKS.SOUND IS OK OK.ONLY FOR LISTENING MUSIC.BUT WHEN ITS WORK ON PHONE CONVERSATION.ITS SOUND IS LOW.NOT LOUD.BUT CALM.I THINK ITS RECORD SONGS ALSO GOOD.BUT NOT SORRY.ONLY BASS IS GOOD.OTHERWISE.NOT SOOO MUCH GOOD ABOUT SOUND QUALITY.,3
best earphones at this price range. best sound best base and best quality..,4
This product is really very nice. The design is exceptionally good. The way it fits in the ear is good. The sound quality is good with respect to the money that is paid.,5
best thing about this earphone is that it perfectly fits in ear and sound quality is very clear and bass good product at this price @ 380,4
it's a great buy for such a feasible price.. go for earphones for regular use and has great sound quality,4
"It can sustain , not so bassy! but still has some good bass.. its fine and good at this price point",5
best inear type earphone sound quality is awesome and wire quality is also very best highly recommended for this price range,5
I think it's the best earphone under 1K category you can even feel the thump of music....awesome sound quality with amazing bass and balanced treble..Go for it for sure♥️,5
The sound quality is very impressive but according to its name it does not give that much of bass as expected. The cable could've been a bit longer. The button interface is quite amazing and useful. In total it's a good set but the name is not appropriate according to its performance and it could've been better.,4
Good quality for everyday use. Although it claims it is bass rich but there is not enough bass. So it will disappoint the high bass music lovers. The functional key is good and you can perform all the function which it has claimed with very ease.,4
it is good product. bass is very good. but I think that if smoothness of wire can more smooth and sound quality is good but in full volume sounds is not clear.,4
Excellent sound quality. Good fit to ear. Though mic quality could have been better. But within this price range its a great buy,5
"It is the best earphone i hv ever used. its AWWSOMMME. Pure quality product. delivered in 4days. The delivery boy is also well behaved. In one word ""SATISFIED""",5
"its amazing , i appreciate with this product and nice bass nice sound",5
"The headphone is a value for money product. In fact, more than that. I have tried many headphones in this price range but I found this to be the best of all of them. No issues, bass is decent, sound quality is very good. No distortion whatsoever. Trust me, you won't find any better headphone at this price.",4
An exceptionally good product at this price range. Sound quality is very good. Got delivery as scheduled. Overall a must buy product at this price range. Thank you.,5
"I was really sceptical about this earphone. Because I am very particular about the quality of the sound.But I was mighty impressed by this boAt BassHeads 100 earphone.Really good overall sound!Doesn't sound like anything below 2000/-Bass is great. Treble is perfect.A 5 Star earphone for sound quality.For design, I will give 3.5, because it is sharp on the outside.Should You buy it for this price(Rs. 394)..?   OH YES!",5
I will strong recommend this💕 sound clarity is awesome & it's comfortably fit for my ears 💞,5
extraordinary sound system. just like watching a movie in home theater like experience.. design superb quality superb. awesome product.,5
sometimes the earplugs left or right side feel like doesn't work properly,3
"good quality and heatset comfortable fit in the ear, volume adjustment butten absent heatset specifications volume button available, microphone is so long distance voice not clear to catch out. nice sound surrounding noise cancellation very nice.",4
great product great sound quality best thing is that sound is not audible to others even at full volume and giving extra buds was a great choice.,5
THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE #OZM JUST LOVED IT DEEP BASE AND PRETTY GOOD SOUND QUALITY,5
I'm happy to buy this product because the bass is good but it won't perfectly sit in ear ..,1
nice product!!!  good bass and awesome sound quality..... but it is not gold plated😠,5
"Finishing and earpieces are good. Sound clarity and bass are excellent. Good buy. BoAt products are good and this happens to be my second BoAt buy, after wireless Bluetooth headset.",5

very good bass at this price very good product with good voice clear,5
wow super headphones with great price am surprised really good sound quality,4
Pretty impressed regarding the price it demands. Not tremendous bass to be expected but the clarity is upto the mark and has basic bass output.,5
perfect earphones with powerful base and sound quality and the best part is microphone is available in such price range of 399,4
Boat earphone sound quality is really nice. High bass and clear sound even in high volume also comfortable for several hours of listening. hot keys make it easy of receiving calls during driving also help to skip songs. The only problem is it doesn't have volume button.  Price under budget.,4
Should have ordered other Better Boat earphone .... this one is ok with quality good and light but sound is sharp and bass is too low ...,3
Headset is good enough..I purchased it on July 2018 and till now its working perfectly.. I am happy with this product. I will recommend it to all..,5
"I ordered these earphones  after comparing with other brands Such as MI, and i am glad that i buy these , the reviews is as follows-1.Sound Quality is awsome2.Bass is best in this price range3.Button response and mic quality is also best in the range",5

"the product quality is good but I'm giving 2 stars because it's not gold plated ,in your description  it's said that the jack is gold plated.",4
Earphone is too good and mic is also good but the system of receiving call via button is not available here. So this earphone is moderate.,3
"Worth ₹400. ?Delivered before given date. ?Though it’s sound is not much realistic as headphones but still better than some costliest earphones I have ever tried.. Bass is just awesome..And the perfect designed for me.. perfect fit to my ears, looks too much great..

Superb earphone i like it.... and the sound is just awsome....  ye earphone apple k earphone ko competition de dega.....  Not better than apple earphone... but km v nai hai apple k earphone se....,5
"I was using apple earphones in my 6s plus for the last year and let me tell you guys apple earphones are far better than anything you will found at least in the range of 2000, be it Bluetooth headphones or any kind of headphones.Then i came across with the brand named BOAT.Guys believe me at this price range you will never find a better option than boat.The sound is amazing with clean treble and with a good amount of base.Although the apple ones are far better but still in this price ...",4
"Best in class. Sound quality is very amazing with excellent treble. Bass is also nice. Don't expect the bass to be like the one on jbl or senhizer earphones. Its slightly less than the them.Build quality is amazing, design is good.",5
It's very very good product and than bass sounds are so good comfortable once this product is very good thanks @FLIPKART,5

"Got it in ₹ 199. nice build quality with good sound quality. In ₹ 199, it is a nice product.",4
sound is really good the bass is awesome and it fits well in your ears worth buying it,5
It is best value for money product. Sound quality is nice and bass is optimum. But they don't provide volume control buttons as they hav mentioned. But overall it is one of the best earphone at this price range. 👍,4
Awesome... worth for money. Good bass and nice sound clarity,3
"The earphone is really good. Its durable too coz I've been using it since 8 months now & I haven't found any issue yet. And I'm a rough user too, so it has really lived up to my expectations. Coming to its sound quality, it has good bass with clear sound but you might need to adjust it according to your appropriate ear buds, since the sound depends on them accordingly. Final Verdict: Its one the best earphones that you can ever have under 600, just go for it!",5
it's just fantastic... I gifted it to my girlfriend cum wife on her b'day... ssly I got a cute hugs n kisses for that bcz she is music n mine lovers also... so she loves these headphones bcz I gave her also the sound quality of that headphones 😘😘😘,5
Product is awesome but not happy with the delivery...ordered it on 13th october and received on 29...must work on this...should have given 5 stars if it was delivered in 4-5 days,3
"Its looks great. Design is very cool , sound quality is nice but no bass at all . I am using 3rd party app to listen bass even though its not good .",4
Good quality earphones. The sound is pretty amazing and the ear bud are comfy and soft. Received good value for money.,5
I loved the head design. Good bass and sound quality. mic should be placed bit more upper side. Worth buying for regular use.,4
Fits in comfort . Bass is super . sound quality good. overall a good choice to buy under 500. i brought it around rs 435 on big billion day.,5
"very good product, good sound clarity and bass effect is superb... and very good service by ekart delivery boy",5
Awesome Earplugs.. Bass is Very Good .. and The Sound Quality is too good .. Worth to buy it ..,5
"good quality earphone , also good sound quality not bad but if you want better than this you may go for boat bass 225 is much better than this .also right side speaker has low volume than left side. I don't like flat cable so I purchased this , I have both these earphones, if have you any questions please reply",3
good headphone not have excellent bass but sound quality is very good ... Excellent at this price point 399.,4
Now first of all a great product.The volume is great I mean even at 60 or 70% it has a great voice.Great bass.Nice design and build.A good finished product.Also 2 more small things to add up which according to me are great.1)Extra earbuds(2 pairs) Even if u lose any no worries...2)The velcro to keep the chord in good shape since the chord is quite long.Overall a great purchase. Happy :),5
"Compatible to every device and very handy to use. Comfortable for travel, sport, and outdoors. You also get extra ear buds with different sizes. In short, A Best buy.",4
nice headfone ... very good bird wing looks ... bass is best .... sound is also nice ... but wire is thin .... and with in buget,4
Got it for 399/- in big billion sale ..sound is awesome comparing any 1000 rs earphones bass is super awesome t this price point the quality of sount is excellent everyone should go for it and I knw that boats service is also at par beacause of my previous exp...For gym users I won’t recommend since thr is a wire and no ear support n no sweat control but seeing the price is worth everything,5
Great but have to work on Balance sound quality like Sounds magic es 18 have.. other all good .. Some times boss irrited not give balance sound .,4
"probably the best earphone i have used... in all the departments it's doing Preety well and the design is also cool i like it... well, i will say worth of buying this headset...",5
A must buy product! Such awesome sound quality and good built. High ends are crisp and Low ends are clear! The bass is too good!,5
"Bass is precise, sound quality is pretty good.. Decent build quality... It would have been a good idea if they would have provide a flat wire.",4
"good product & comfortable design easily fix in the ear , excellent sound quality , worth for money",4
"sound is better and product quality is also good. After using a month, i want to say that it is good for sound but not better for calling. It is irritable to make and speak on the call. A mic remains too far, a caller or receiver can not hear our sound clearly. so that i didn't like this. I feeling that i should not to buy this.Disgusting!",3
Well good product but as per the review says the bass is not that much upto the mark but yeah it gives very clear vocals i'm using mi a1 I tested it on redmi note 5 pro too in comparison it gives good output on mi a1 but bass is low,3
Awesome product . Value for money. It has one year warranty so users have to register themselves in the BOAT  website about their product issue date and details of invoice should be uploaded. sound quality and microphone is best and wire seems to be tangible and is of good quality. Want good and long lasting product at better price then go for it to buy.,5
"Good headset to listen soft n melody music only...not so great for beat songs.Perfect in ear,But some annoying sound will come if touch anywgere on headset after u earing the headset.Overall a good headset.",3
"Good sound quality but if you really want deep bass, I would suggest you go for 225. These earphones are very good in themselves though and you'll love the sharpness of mids and highs with lows coming at precisely right moments. moreover,  the build is very light weight, so wearing them for longer times is a breeze.",4
"seriously this is a good product, clarity is good ,design is looking cool design is good.... hope it will last long coz I just got this today..... I recommend this product...",5
"its a nice headset ordered it for 450/- during some offer...worth moneyoverall:its good given the price range but not the best headphone(its my personal opinion that pay a lil more and get the best,but if u really need one and u have a budget under 500/- then just go for it.... 👍)",4
Good sound quality but not the best. Bass is average. I would recommend sennheiser cx180 II street. It  offers much more clarity in sound than boat.,3
"The quality of the product at this given price range is immaculate. I'm not a crazy bass guy. I like every parts of the sound range to be covered equally, I love clarity in the notes and voice without sacrificing the low end. I got it in this one. This being cheap, I use it as a daily driver.",4
In this price range... this earphone is perfect👌👌 Overall bass is great and clarity is good..Way more better than normal white classic Samsung earphone that comes with cheap samsung phones,5
nice head set looks good and also its working more than 6months still same hearing qlty. its in ear head set good one for mobile and laptop,4
Good Headset...nice sound quality...A little high treble... worked  awsome till last night.... In morning I saw it was converted into pieces by mouse... felt heart broked ...they should also include this into warranty ....hahahaha.... but yesss...it was worth buying.... Go For... it guys ....thanks,5
"I want to bass headphones and this headphones do not have to bass    my have a 200 price headphones it's have a good bass good sound quality, and i am not like this  headphones I am not comfortable to 500 price this headphones",3
"Under 400Rs this was best deal earphone, gives great sound under low power also, should not be used with heavy instruments. Must buy the Trust of BOAT and crispy sound, low price earphones.",5
Very good earphone with this price range... I got it for ₹540 nd boat earphones have always been good impact.. So go through this... Aur 600 range me boat ka 220 wired is Awesome.. With super  extra bass,5
just Awesome .....works very well with my Phone. clear sound and make music enjoyable,5
"this product is good ,I like it and it is also price valuable and good stereo",5
I got some repair and my product was replaced it's o easy and trusted brand. and thank you flipkart for the customer care and help to replace my product.. thanks alot,5
bass is good but it has not sub bass so when you want listen a sub bass song..this one is not for you but if you want a above average quality bass then this is good for you..and the mids part means vocals and background instruments sound are very good...so overall its a good earphone with some conditional benefits..,3
Got gor 449.. Worth the money..... Bass is good.... Design looks great in photo but it is very lite when you handle it. On the whole good headset at this price. The thing i liked is you a get velcro kind of band to tie up the wires.,5
"Not for Melody lovers, it should imitate when on running and specifically partly audible when driving. Without Driving, 320KBPS rated songs is great @ normal volume. But this brand providing regulatory audible dbl's. So I rated it 4 stars. Moving to another e-commerce websites/apps is better to move on with the best price.",4
"Best product. Must buy it  i have bought this on independance day sale,comparing with my jbl ci150 the only difference from jbl was bass is not so powerful, but good treble, good quality, i think this is the only headset with cheap and best",5
Very good and handy. Easy to use and best quality sound. Have to test its durability from now on.,5
"Awesome headphones wasn't expecting that,it is a perfect product for people those who love to hear music with good sound clarity and quality",5
Bought this for a friend and he was very happy with it. Said the bass was satisfactory and the design is really cool too.,5
This earphone is good choice...and way more better than Philips one.But if you are buying this one expecting good Bass it's better you go for Bassheads 220,4
"design is best in class.sound quality is exceptional , although bass is a little high but if u r a musichead ur gonna love it😍😍.   delivery is fast",4
"the product is amazing. good sound quality, great bass, great design & good at cheap price. thanks flipkart for your service.",5

"fantastic , bold, beautiful'. great bass,ultimate  sound just go fur it .  it's a best u can get in market",5

awesome earphone sound is nice I like it....I have ordered three piece of this product because everything is perfect. in this earphone sound. bass quality etc all r perfect....I will highly recommend this earphone..,5
Value for money Great earphone sound clarity is also great Don't know much about technicalality But audio output is crisp and Mike works fine too I have bassheads 225 too Nd there's nothing much difference yeah this fits in ear not like 225 in which u need something setup to fit in ear,5
"Pros: - Sound in this earphone is crisp clear and is fine for the one who don't like too much bass.Cons: - Mic placement is in the mid so at the time of call you have to pick it with your hands till your mouth, speak loudly other wise. - Mic stopped working within 30 days of use although i've sent them back for replacement. Not received response yet after 10 days of pickup from my location.Conclusion:If you like the clear sound earphone without too much bass then go for it. If your pur...",2
Bought it on 16 July 2018 at ₹439 (including ₹40 delivery charge). Earphones are pretty good with strong build and nice bass. Sound is clear and mic is also of good quality. Reason to choose this one is it comes with 1 year warranty,4
best earphone.. good bass good sound.. awesome wire quality... deserving a 5 star.. better than skullcandy jib series.. equivalent to one more priston fit and audio technica... and jbl 110 model,5
Its a good value product however the jack is not gold plated as written in the description so the sound quality is not as good as at could have bben,3

"I have used JBL inspire 300YB, HOM Smile Jamaica EM-JE041-SB, Sound Magic Es 18, Boat BassHead 225, sennheiser cx 180 and some other jbl series under 1.5k.  Comparing those this is a good but not best product.  # The best part of this product is stylish look. # The build quality and bass is high. # Only bad part I found is echoing while on a call. The person on the other hand will get echo of his own voice. Sadly I figured out after a month when the replacement time had already finished. So c...",3
